  Abstract = {The formation and theological behavior of a viscoelastic
                  wormlike micellar solution in an aqueous solution of
                  a mixed surfactant system of alkyl ethoxylate
                  sulfate (AES), C12H25(OCH2CH2)(3)OSO3-Na+, and
                  polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether, C12EO3, and the
                  unusual effect of temperature on the rheological
                  behavior have been studied. Upon successive addition
                  Of C12EO3 to the dilute micellar solution of AES,
                  viscosity increases swiftly and reaches its peak
                  where a viscoelastic solution with nearly Maxwellian
                  behavior is formed. With the further addition Of
                  C12EO3, viscosity decreases sharply, which is
                  attributed to the formation of micellar joints. With
                  increasing temperature, the extent of micellar
                  growth increases and the viscosity maximum is
                  achieved at a lower mixing fraction of C12EO3, but
                  the maximum viscosity attained by the system
                  decreases. The evolution of relaxation time and
                  network density of the viscoelastic network also
                  suggests that with increasing temperature, enhanced
                  micellar growth takes place, but an additional,
                  faster relaxation mechanism becomes increasingly
                  favorable at high concentrations Of C12EO3. These
                  results can be explained in terms of the increase in
                  free energy of hemispherical end-caps (end-cap
                  energy) of the micelles with increasing
                  temperature. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

  Abstract = {The phase behavior of the Triton X100/water binary
                  mixture is investigated using rheological, optical,
                  and X-ray synchrotron techniques. In particular, the
                  storage shear modulus G' response, Lis a function of
                  temperature and strain amplitude, has been related
                  to the structural transformation into the hexagonal
                  phase of cylindrical micelles. Results demonstrate a
                  characteristic critical behavior at the phase
                  transition boundary T = T,. However, we also find
                  that the rheological signature of the ordering phase
                  transition crucially depends on the particular
                  dynamical mode applied to the sample. Stress-strain
                  variation reflects the shear-induced alignment of
                  the principle column axis, which results in the
                  two-dimensional melting of hexagonal order and the

               and CTAB/Brij (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, n = 10 and 23) in 
               aqueous and sodium chloride solutions. The relative viscosity 
               of single nonionic surfactant solutions is larger than that of 
               SDS or CTAB solutions. It increases with the number of ethylene 
               oxide groups. In the mixed systems, viscosity deviates from 
               ideal behavior. The deviation results from electrostatic 
               interactions. The surfactant mixture composition affects the 
               self-assembled microstructure and rheology. A new mixed system 
               that forms clear micellar solution above CMC was detected. In 
               CTAB/Brij systems, the experimental data also deviate from 
               ideal behavior due to mixed micelle formation and 
               electroviscous effect. This effect is less pronounced than that 
               of SDS/CTAB system and could be suppressed by adding an 
               electrolyte (NaCl).},

  Abstract = {We report on the first time-resolved small-angle neutron

                  from a shear-induced aligned state back to the
                  isotropic state in a system of giant wormlike
                  reverse micelles. The micelles are formed by
                  lecithin and small amounts of water in
                  cyclohexane. A liquid sample with the micellar
                  volume fraction phi = 0.3 was exposed to a steady
                  shear of (gamma) over dot = 10 s(-1) in a Couette
                  shear cell. This was sufficient to transform the
                  whole sample into an aligned state with the
                  polymer-like micelles preferentially oriented
                  parallel to the velocity direction. After cessation
                  of shear, the sample relaxes back to the equilibrium
                  liquid phase. By time-resolved SANS we could follow
                  the relaxation process, which is characterized by a
                  continuous decrease of the order parameter.},

                  oscillation and rheochaos in shear thickening
                  complex fluids at zero Reynolds number. In the
                  model, a tendency towards inhomogeneous flows in the
                  form of shear bands combines with a slow structural
                  dynamics, modeled by delayed stress
                  relaxation. Using Fourier-space numerics, we study
                  the nonequilibrium phase diagram of the fluid as a
                  function of a steady mean (spatially averaged)
                  stress, and of the relaxation time for structural
                  relaxation. We find several distinct regions of
                  periodic behavior (oscillating bands, traveling
                  bands, and more complex oscillations) and also
                  regions of spatiotemporal rheochaos. A

  Abstract = {We report our studies of the linear and nonlinear

                  cetyl trimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) with varying
                  amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl). The CTAT
                  concentration is fixed at 42 mM, and the salt
                  concentration is varied between 0 and 120 mM. On
                  increasing the salt (NaCl) concentration, we see
                  three distinct regimes in the zero-shear viscosity
                  and the high-frequency plateau modulus data. In
                  regime 1, the zero-shear viscosity shows a weak
                  increase with salt concentration due to enhanced
                  micellar growth. The decrease in the zero-shear
                  viscosities with salt concentration in regimes II
                  and III can be explained in terms of intermicellar
                  branching. The most intriguing feature of our data,
                  however, is the anomalous behavior of the
                  high-frequency plateau modulus in regime II (0.12
                  less than or equal to [NaCl]/[CTAT] less than or
                  equal to 1.42). In this regime, the plateau modulus
                  increases with an increase in NaCl
                  concentration. This is highly interesting, since the
                  correlation length of concentration fluctuations and
                  hence the plateau modulus G(0) are not expected to
                  change appreciably in the semidilute regime. We
                  propose to explain the changes in regime II in terms
                  of a possible unbinding of the organic counterions
                  (tosylate) from the CTA(+) surfaces on the addition
                  of NaCl. In the nonlinear flow curves of the samples
                  with high salt content, significant deviations from
                  the predictions of the Giesekus model for entangled

  Abstract = {The flow in a pipe of wormlike micellar solutions is
                  examined using a simple model that consists of the
                  codeformational Maxwell constitutive equation and a
                  kinetic equation that accounts for the breaking and
                  reformation of micelles. The model needs six
                  parameters, all, of which are extracted from single
                  independent rheological experiments. One of the
                  parameters, the shear-banding intensity parameter is
                  associated with the stress plateau in the
                  shear-banding region. The stress plateau is set in
                  our model by the criterion of equal extended Gibbs
                  free energy of the bands. The model predicts a
                  Newtonian (parabolic profile) flow at low-shear
                  rates or low-pressure gradients, followed by shear
                  thinning up to a critical rate where instabilities
                  and long transients appear. At this critical shear
                  rate, a shear-banding flow region arises near the
                  pipe wall. The model indicates that tube lengths up
                  to 400 diameters are required to obtain fully
                  developed flow, where a pluglike profile at the
                  center of the tube coexists with a region supporting
                  a much higher shear rate next to the
                  wall. Shear-banding flow is present up to a second
                  critical shear rate. At shear rates larger than the
                  second critical rate, the parabolic velocity profile
                  is recovered, except near the center of the tube

                  because the stress at that radial position is equal
                  to the plateau stress. This is a consequence of the
                  linear dependence of the shear stress with the pipe
                  radius. The predictions of the model are compared

                  0.5 M NaCl-brine. Both semidilute and concentrated
                  regimes of entangled micelles were
                  investigated. Rheological experiments were performed
                  at ambient temperature (T = 25-degrees-C) for
                  surfactant concentrations phi = 1 \%-30 \%. When
                  submitted to a steady shear high enough (for shear
                  rate gamma typically higher than 1-10 s-1) the
                  solutions of wormlike micelles exhibit a first-order

                  concentrations phi greater-than-or-equal-to 6

                  plateau in the shear rate dependence of the shear
                  stress sigma (gamma). For gamma above the transition
                  rate gamma(I/N), sigma remains constant at
                  sigma(I/N). In the concentrated regime, the
                  transition is clearly first-order. However, the
                  first-order character weakens upon increasing
                  dilution, suggesting that at some critical
                  concentration phi(c) it becomes second-order. Below
                  phi(c), the transition ceases to occur : the
                  sigma(gamma)-behavior rather indicates a progressive
                  and homogeneous orientation of the micelles
                  throughout the sample. Moreover, in the two-phase
                  domain (where both isotropic and nematic phases
                  coexist) a characteristic transient behavior of the
                  shear stress sigma(t) measured at constant gamma >
                  gamma(I/N) as a function of time has been observed

                  domain of metastability), the transient behavior
                  could be interpreted quantitatively in terms of
                  nucleation and one-dimensional growth process. These
                  results are finally compared to recent predictions
                  by Spenley, Cates and MacLeish (Ref. [7]) who

                  12\% has been investigated (T = 20.3 degrees
                  C). This strongly viscoelastic surfactant solution
                  is an almost perfect Maxwellian fluid in the
                  low-frequency range (omega < 100 rads(-1)). The
                  stress relaxation function G(t) is decreasing
                  monoexponentially as G(t) = G(0) exp(-t/tau(R)),
                  where G(0) (=240 Pa) is the elastic plateau modulus
                  and tau(R) (=1.0 s) the terminal relaxation
                  time. The fundamental feature of the nonlinear
                  rheology is the evidence of a constant and robust
                  stress plateau (no hysteresis) above a
                  characteristic strain rate labeled (gamma) over dot
                  I/N ((gamma) over dot I/N = 0.9 +/- 0.05 s(-1)). The
                  solution at phi = 12\% was selected because recent
                  flow birefringence experiments revealed that the
                  stress plateau mentioned previously is associated
                  with a nonhomogeneous flow. Two phases of different
                  birefringence and submitted to different velocity
                  gradients have been clearly evidenced in the plateau
                  region. Here we focus on the time dependence of the
                  stress in start-up experiments. Varying the shear
                  rate ((gamma) over dot = 0.05-10 s(-1)), we have
                  identified three time ranges corresponding to three
                  kinds of responses of the entangled network of
                  wormlike micelles. At very short time (t much less
                  than tau(R)), the wormlike micelles reacts as an
                  elastic solid. At times of the order of tau(R)
                  occurs the purely mechanical response of the
                  system. The associated stress as a function of shear
                  rate is interpreted in terms of mechanical
                  instability. Remarkably, this regime exhibits strong
                  similarities with that of conventional polymers:
                  stress overshoot around t similar to tau(R) and
                  damped oscillations at high strain rates. On the
                  long-time scale (t much greater than tau(R)) and for
                  (gamma) over dot > (gamma) over dot I/N, the system
                  undergoes the transition toward a strongly
                  inhomogeneous flow, which can be ascribed to the
                  isotropic/nematic shear-induced transition. The
                  present findings suggest finally that, in wormlike
                  micellar solution, the purely mechanical instability
                  does exist but is preempted by the transition toward
                  an (nematic) inhomogeneous now.},

                  surfactant wormlike micelles subjected to steady
                  shear flow. The system placed under scrutiny is made
                  of cetylpyridinium chloride, sodium salicylate, and
                  salted water at 0.5M NaCl (abbreviated as
                  CPCl-Sal). We have investigated solutions in the
                  intermediate concentration ranges, at phi=6\%, 8\%
                  and phi=12\% for temperatures ranging between 20
                  degrees C and 50 degrees C. In these T and phi
                  ranges, we first confirm that the present system is
                  a true Maxwell fluid. As a consequence, the
                  nonlinear rheology can be formulated in terms of the
                  normalized quantities, sigma{*}=sigma/G(0) and
                  gamma{*}=gamma tau(R), where G(0) is the elastic
                  plateau modulus and tau(R) the terminal relaxation
                  time of the Maxwell fluid. Second, we demonstrate
                  that the flow curves of the CPCl-Sal wormlike
                  micelles sigma{*} (gamma{*}) are invariant with
                  respect to relative changes in temperature and
                  concentration. This enables us to define
                  superimposition procedures between flow curves
                  obtained at different temperatures and
                  concentrations and to derive the so-called `'master
                  dynamic phase diagram'' of the CPCl-Sal wormlike
                  micelles. One crucial feature of this master phase
                  diagram is the existence of a critical behavior at
                  T=T-c. Here, the stress sigma{*} levels off
                  progressively up to a plateau that is reduced to a
                  single flat point of coordinates (sigma{*}=0.9,
                  gamma{*}=3). The low-temperature regime (T<T-c) is
                  again identified by a shear stress plateau beginning
                  by a true discontinuity of slope in the sigma{*}
                  (gamma{*}) behavior. At high T (>T-c), sigma{*}
                  increases monotonously at all shear rates. In order
                  to examine the state of shearing at the stress

  Abstract = {We have investigated the simple shear flow behavior of
                  wormlike micelles using small-angle neutron
                  scattering and mechanical measurements. Ternary
                  surfactant solutions made of cetylpyridinium
                  chloride, hexanol and brine (0.2 M NaCl) and
                  hereafter abbreviated as CPCl-Hex were studied in
                  the concentrated regime, phi similar to 30\% In a
                  preliminary report (Berret et al. [16]), the
                  discontinuity of slope observed in the shear stress
                  versus shear rate curve was interpreted in terms of
                  first-order phase transition between an isotropic
                  state and a shear-induced nematic state (I-N
                  transition). At the transition rate: (gamma) over
                  dot = (gamma) over dot(I-N), the solution exhibits a
                  macroscopic phase separation into viscous and fluid
                  layers (inhomogeneous shear flow). Above a second
                  characteristic shear rate, the flow becomes
                  homogeneous again, the sheared solution being
                  nematic only. The neutron patterns obtained in the
                  two-state inhomogeneous region have been
                  re-examined. Based on a consistent analysis of both
                  orientational and translational degrees of freedom
                  related to the wormlike micelles, we emphasize new
                  features for the I-N transition. In the present
                  paper; the shear rate variations of the relative
                  proportions of each phase in the two-state region,
                  as well as the viscosity ratio between isotropic and
                  nematic phases are derived. We demonstrate in
                  addition that slightly above the transition rate;
                  the shear induced nematic phase is already strongly
                  oriented, with an order parameter P-2 = 0.65. The
                  orientational state is that of a nematic
                  flow-oriented monodomain. Finally, from the
                  locations of the neutron scattering maxima for each
                  isotropic and nematic contributions, we evaluate the
                  concentrations for each phase phi(I) and phi N and
                  derived a dynamical phase diagram of CPCl-Hex, in
                  terms of the stress sigma versus phi(I) and
                  phi(N). According to the classification by Schmitt
                  et al. [22], the I-N transition observed in CPCl-Hex
                  micellar solutions could result from a positive
                  flow-concentration coupling, in agreement with the
                  observed monotonically increasing shear stress in
                  the two-phase region.},

                  equations governing the density and velocity fields
                  from the microscopic dynamics, in the framework of
                  the associated Boltzmann equation. Explicit
                  expressions for the transport coefficients are
                  given, as a function of the microscopic parameters
                  of the model. We show that the homogeneous state
                  with zero hydrodynamic velocity is unstable above a
                  critical density (which depends on the microscopic
                  parameters), signalling the onset of a collective
                  motion.  Comparison with numerical simulations on a
                  standard model of self-propelled particles shows
                  that the phase diagram we obtain is robust, in the

  Abstract = {A filament stretching extensional rheometer and
                  capillary breakup extensional rheometer are used to
                  measure the extensional rheology of a series of
                  wormlike micelle solutions experiencing a uniaxial
                  elongational flow. The experiments are performed
                  using a series of wormlike micelle solutions of both
                  cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate
                  (NaSal) in an aqueous sodium chloride solution and
                  cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and NaSal in
                  de-ionized water. The linear viscoelasticity of all
                  the wormlike micelle solutions is well described by
                  a Maxwell model with just one or two relaxation
                  times while the steady shear measurements all
                  demonstrate characteristics of shear banding at
                  large shear rates. In transient homogeneous uniaxial
                  extension imposed by a filament stretching
                  rheometer, each of the wormlike micelle solutions
                  demonstrate significant strain hardening. At large
                  extension rates, the wormlike micelle solution
                  filaments are all found to fail through a dramatic
                  rupture near the axial midplane at a constant stress
                  independent of imposed extension rate. The result is
                  an extensional viscosity that decays linearly with
                  increasing extension rate. This filament failure
                  likely stems from the local scission of individual
                  wormlike micelle chains. For the more concentrated
                  solutions, as the imposed extension rate is reduced,
                  a critical extension rate is found below which the
                  filament does not rupture, but instead
                  elastocapillary pinch off is recovered and the
                  elastic tensile stresses achieved in the fluid
                  filament grow far beyond the value observed at
                  rupture. This dramatic upturn in the elastic tensile
                  stress and the extensional viscosity at low
                  extension rates is not intuitively expected and is
                  most likely a result of structural changes to the
                  entangled wormlike micelle solution. Strain
                  hardening is also observed in capillary breakup
                  rheometry experiments, however, when the results of
                  filament stretching and capillary breakup rheometry
                  measurements at nominally the same extension rate
                  are superimposed, the results do not agree; the
                  extensional viscosity measurements from filament
                  stretching are in some instances more than an order
                  of magnitude larger. This result calls into question
                  the use of capillary breakup rheometry for
                  quantitatively measuring the extensional viscosity
                  of wormlike rnicelle solutions. (c) 2007 The Society

                  extensional flows is investigated using a pre-shear
                  device attached to a filament stretching
                  rheometer. In filament stretching experiments,
                  increasing the strength and the duration of the
                  pre-shearjust before stretch is found to delay the
                  onset of strain hardening. In these experiments, the
                  wormlike micelle solution filaments fail through a
                  rupture near the axial midplane. The value of the
                  elastic tensile stress at rupture is found to
                  decrease with increasing pre-shear rate and
                  duration. The most dramatic effects are observed at
                  shear rates for which shear banding has been
                  independently observed. The reduction in the strain
                  hardening suggests that pre-shear before filament
                  stretching might break down the wormlike micelles
                  reducing their size before stretch. Strain hardening
                  is also observed in capillary breakup rheometry
                  experiments; however, the pre-sheared wormlike
                  micelle solutions strain harden faster, achieve
                  larger steadystate extensional viscosities and an
                  increase in the extensional relaxation time with
                  increasing shear rate and duration. The difference

                  filament stretching and capillary breakup
                  experiments demonstrates the sensitivity of these

                  for designing optimal industrial fluid formulations
                  such as responsive oilfield fluids, based on
                  viscoelastic surfactant solutions, We have carried
                  out extensive molecular dynamics simulations,
                  resolving the full chemical details in order to
                  study how the structure of the lamellar phase of
                  viscoelastic surfactant solutions depends on the
                  head group (HG) chemistry of the surfactant. In
                  particular, we consider anionic carboxylate and
                  quaternary ammonium HGs with erucyl tails in aqueous
                  solutions together with their sodium and chloride
                  counterions at room temperature. We find a strong HG
                  dependence of the lamellar structure as
                  characterized by suitable pair correlation functions
                  and density distributions. The depth of penetration
                  of water into the bilayer membrane, the nature of
                  counterion condensation on the HGs and even the

                  depend sensitively on the chemical details of the

                  lamellar system as a first step to using
                  atom-resolved molecular dynamics in order to link
                  the molecular and macroscopic scales of length and
                  time. The results give important insight into the
                  links between molecular details and surfactant phase
                  structure which is being exploited to develop more

  Abstract = {There is a great need for understanding the relationship
                  between the structure and chemistry of surfactants
                  forming wormlike micelles, and their macroscopic
                  flow properties. Available macroscopic Rheological
                  Equations of State (REoS) are often inadequate to
                  predict flow behaviour in complex geometries or even
                  to describe the full set of rheological
                  measurements. In this paper, we show how the link
                  between surfactant structure and rheology can be
                  explored through the use of mesoscopic particulate
                  simulations. We describe the development of a
                  realistic Brownian Dynamics model, where the
                  persistence length of the micelle is the smallest
                  length scale. Most of the parameters for the BD
                  model are obtained from atomistic Molecular Dynamics
                  simulations to establish the link to the chemistry
                  of the surfactant. As a preliminary result, we
                  calculate the shear viscosity of a solution of
                  entangled wormlike micelles as a function of
                  increasing shear rate. The results can be
                  approximately mapped on an experimental flow curve
                  for this particular system, using a mean field
                  scaling relationship. Finally, as our motivation in
                  this work is to understand the flow of wormlike
                  micellar fluids in porous media, we give preliminary
                  experimental results for the flow in an
                  expansion-contraction capillary using micro Particle
                  Image Velocimetry (mu-PIV). This demonstrates the
                  complex response of these fluids in non-viscometric
                  flows and the challenges they pose to any predictive
                  simulation model. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

                  now continues to pose a challenge to

                  with equilibrium phase transitions(3). Here we
                  approach this idea experimentally, presenting
                  evidence of a strong analogy between the statistical
                  behaviour of a confined turbulent now and that of a
                  model of the critical behaviour of a
                  ferromagnet. Both systems experience large
                  fluctuations limited only by the system size. We
                  find that the power consumption measured in
                  turbulent-now experiments and the magnetization at
                  the critical point of the ferromagnet have
                  probability distributions of the same functional
                  form, irrespective of Reynolds number on the one
                  hand and system size on the other. The distributions
                  both have non-gaussian tails that characterize the
                  large-amplitude fluctuations. In this region, the
                  scaled distributions for the two systems collapse
                  onto a single universal curve over at least four
                  orders of magnitude. This suggests a basic
                  similarity in the finite-size corrections to the
                  fluctuation statistics in the Limit of infinite
                  system size (for the magnetic system) or infinite

                  shear-induced coalescence of emulsions, and the
                  latter by incorporating the tension-deformation
                  effects due to flow. Steady-state solutions to the
                  kinetic equation are obtained, with the
                  corresponding mean micellar size (LBAR) evaluated as
                  a function of the Peclet number P, i.e., the
                  dimensionless ratio of flow rate-gamma and
                  rotational diffusion coefficient D(r). For
                  sufficiently dilute solutions, we find only a weak
                  dependence of LBAR on P. In the semidilute regime,
                  however, an apparent divergence in LBAR at P
                  congruent-to 1 suggests a flow-induced first-order
                  gelation phenomenon.},

  Abstract = {We report here experimental results of the linear and
                  non-linear theological properties of concentrated
                  aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
                  (CTAB) without addition of salt. The range of
                  concentration studied in this work is just before a
                  static liquid crystalline phase is obtained. The
                  flow curves show three different and well
                  characterized domains of evolution. In the first
                  part of the curve, the Newtonian part, we obtain as
                  a function of concentration a very unusual power law
                  exponent of nearly 12 for the zero shear viscosity
                  eta(0) and 62 for a terminal relaxation time. The
                  second region is characterized by a plateau value
                  sigma(c) of the shear stress ranging from gamma(1c)
                  to gamma = gamma 2(c). This domain corresponds to
                  the transition from an isotropic to a nematic state
                  with an intermediate biphasic system. The evolution
                  of sigma(c), gamma(1c) and gamma(2c), are given as a
                  function of concentration and temperature to obtain
                  dynamic phase diagrams. The third region shows a new
                  increase of the stress with shear rate. This domain
                  is well defined in our system and is practically
                  independent of temperature and concentration,
                  contrary to the situation in the first and second
                  domains which show a great dependence on these
                  parameters. Measurements of flow birefringence
                  confirm the nature of the phase transition occurring
                  in the second domain and shows the existence of a
                  shear-banding structure for gamma(1c) < gamma <
                  gamma(2c). At present, theory cannot explain all the
                  results obtained in this work.},

                  oscillations that scale with shear strain,
                  attributed to director tumbling under shear. In situ
                  small-angle x-ray scattering spectroscopy is used to
                  measure changes in average micellar orientation
                  during similar transient shear protocols; the
                  measured orientation parameter also exhibits damped
                  oscillations reflecting the underlying tumbling
                  dynamics. Stress and structure data are compared
                  with predictions of the Larson-Doi tumbling
                  polydomain model. The model predictions are
                  qualitatively similar to the experimental

                  to initially decrease upon shear flow reversal in
                  CPCl/hex, in agreement with the Larson-Doi

                  closely related during the oscillatory response to
                  transient flows. The data suggest that higher
                  orientation in the flow direction leads to low
                  instantaneous stresses, and vice versa. The

  Abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations are
                  performed for linear and branched chain molecules to
                  study their rheological and structural properties
                  under simple shear and Poiseuille flows. Molecules
                  are described by a spring-monomer model with a given
                  intermolecular potential. The equations of motion
                  are solved for shear and Poiseuille flows with Lees
                  and Edward's [A. W. Lees and S. F. Edwards,
                  J. Phys. C 5, 1921 (1972)] periodic boundary
                  conditions. A multiple time-scale algorithm extended
                  to nonequilibrium situations is used as the
                  integration method, and the simulations are
                  performed at constant temperature using Nose-Hoover
                  [S. Nose, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 511 (1984)]
                  dynamics. In simple shear, molecules with
                  flow-induced ellipsoidal shape, having significant
                  segment concentrations along the gradient and
                  neutral directions, exhibit substantial flow
                  resistance. Linear molecules have larger
                  zero-shear-rate viscosity than that of branched
                  molecules, however, this behavior reverses as the
                  shear rate is increased. The relaxation time of the
                  molecules is associated with segment concentrations
                  directed along the gradient and neutral directions,
                  and hence it depends on structure and molecular
                  weight. The results of this study are in qualitative
                  agreement with other simulation studies and with
                  experimental data. The pressure (Poiseuille) flow is
                  induced by an external force F-e simulated by
                  confining the molecules in the region between
                  surfaces which have attractive forces. Conditions at
                  the boundary strongly influence the type of the slip
                  flow predicted. A parabolic velocity profile with
                  apparent slip on the wall is predicted under weakly
                  attractive wall conditions, independent of molecular
                  structure. In the case of strongly attractive walls,
                  a layer of adhered molecules to the wall produces an
                  abrupt distortion of the velocity profile which
                  leads to slip between fluid layers with magnitude
                  that depends on the molecular structure. Finally,
                  the molecular deformation under flow depends on the
                  attractive force of the wall, in such a way that
                  molecules are highly deformed in the case of strong
                  attracting walls. (C) 2005 American Institute of

                  predicts a steady-state shear stress which decreases
                  indefinitely as the shear rate is increased. As
                  shown by Marrucci and Grizzuti (Gazz. Chim. Ital.,
                  118 (1988) 179) this feature remains, even when one
                  takes into account chain stretching due to
                  elongation of the tube by the flow. Here we suggest
                  a further mechanism for chain stretching which
                  arises because the tube, even when fully aligned
                  with the flow, has a finite lateral dimension which
                  exposes different parts of the chain to different
                  flow velocities.  Using a simplified model, we
                  predict the asymptotic behaviour of the shear stress
                  and first-normal-stress difference, and show that
                  stable flow is recovered at high enough shear

  Number = {47},
  Pages = {9167-9176},
  Abstract = {Many viscoelastic surfactant solutions contain giant,
                  self-assembled micelles. These can be described as
                  'living polymers', whose chains are subject to
                  reversible scission and recombination. Their
                  dynamics in the entangled regime is accordingly
                  modified from the reptation picture for conventional
                  polymer chains. For rapid scission kinetics, the
                  linear viscoelastic spectrum approaches a
                  single-exponential (Maxwell) behaviou small
                  departures from this can be measured, and the model
                  used to deduce information both on the micellar
                  kinetics (the lifetime of a typical micelle before
                  breaking) and on the structure (the mean micelle
                  length). These ideas work for several systems, but
                  for others, unreasonable trends for these quantities
                  are found. The most likely reason for this is
                  micellar branching effects, which (as far as the
                  reptation-reaction model is concerned) introduce an
                  effective micellar length equal to the mean distance
                  between branch points. Another possible discrepancy
                  comes from the breakdown of mean-held averaging for
                  the micellar reactions. The reptation-reaction model
                  yields a non-linear constitutive equation which
                  shows a non-monotonic dependence of stress on strain
                  rate, in simple steady shear. This leads one to
                  expect flow instabilities, and (with further
                  assumptions) suggests that steady shear-banded hows
                  should arise, in which macroscopic layers of fluid
                  of different shear rates coexist. Several
                  experimental observations support this general
                  picture, although the same instability could instead
                  lead to wall slip, or unsteady flows.},

  Abstract = {Giant micelles are elongated, polymer-like objects
                  created by the self-assembly of amphiphilic
                  molecules ( such as detergents) in solution. Giant
                  micelles are typically flexible, and can become
                  highly entangled even at modest concentrations. The
                  resulting viscoelastic solutions show fascinating
                  flow behaviour (rheology) which we address
                  theoretically in this article at two levels. First,
                  we summarize advances in understanding linear
                  viscoelastic spectra and steady-state nonlinear
                  flows, based on microscopic constitutive models that
                  combine the physics of polymer entanglement with the
                  reversible kinetics of self-assembly. Such models
                  were first introduced two decades ago, and since
                  then have been shown to explain robustly several
                  distinctive features of the rheology in the strongly
                  entangled regime, including extreme shear
                  thinning. We then turn to more complex rheological
                  phenomena, particularly involving spatial
                  heterogeneity, spontaneous oscillation, instability
                  and chaos. Recent understanding of these complex
                  flows is based largely on grossly simplified models
                  which capture in outline just a few pertinent
                  microscopic features, such as coupling between
                  stresses and other order parameters such as
                  concentration. The role of 'structural memory' ( the
                  dependence of structural parameters such as the
                  micellar length distribution on the flow history) in
                  explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is
                  addressed. Structural memory also plays an
                  intriguing role in the little-understood shear
                  thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration
                  regime close to but below the onset of strong
                  entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced

                  concentrations between 20-50 mM at temperatures
                  ranging from 25 degreesC to 45 IC by means of static
                  and dynamic light scattering and rheology, which is
                  an extension of previous experiments on
                  dilute/semi-dilute solutions of SLES micelles at
                  much lower surfactant concentrations in the presence
                  of low salt concentrations (Clancy and Paradies,
                  Z. Phys. Chem. 215, 4, 483-513 (2001)). The light
                  scattering results lead to a description of the
                  solution of wormlike SLES micelles as analogous to
                  semidilute solutions of living polymers in good
                  solvents. The dynamic properties of SLES micelles as
                  shown by the time autocorrelation function of the
                  scattered field was found to be bimodal,
                  particularly between 0.15-0.5 M NaCl (25
                  degreesC). The origin and the influence of
                  surfactant concentration and salt concentration of
                  the bimodal behaviour are investigated in more
                  detail and compared to theoretical models describing
                  coupling of concentration fluctuations to
                  viscoelasticity. Specifically the behaviour of the
                  slow viscoelastic time as a function of temperature,
                  salt, and SLES concentration has been extensively
                  evaluated experimentally and compared with
                  theoretical predictions, revealing that the terminal
                  stress relaxation time obtained from inelastic light
                  scattering measurements is in accord with the
                  rheological experiments. Above the crossover
                  concentration of SLES of phi* congruent to 0.06 the
                  viscoelastic properties are described by an almost
                  ideal Maxwell relaxation. The overall theological
                  data are in agreement with the scaling law with
                  respect to surfactant concentration with exponents
                  close to those predicted from a stress relaxation
                  model applying living polymers. Furthermore. the
                  complex elastic modulus at higher angle frequency
                  obtained can be explained in terms of crossover
                  between the regimes of reversible scission, and of
                  breathing of the polymer-like SLES chains. The
                  average increase of the chain length ((L) over bar)
                  with increasing SLES concentration in the presence
                  of 0.15-0.5 M NaCl at 25 degreesC scales with
                  congruent to phi (0.31-0.34) according to static
                  light scattering measurements. The hydrodynamic
                  correlation length, jj, obtained from inelastic
                  light scattering experiments is best approximated by
                  xi (H) approximate to C-0.78, whereas the
                  correlation length xi (c) scales with C-0.48, which
                  is a significant smaller exponent than predicted of
                  -0.75 theoretically. - The theological and dynamical
                  behaviour of SLES micelles studied in this
                  concentration range, e.g. the transition between
                  dilute to semi-dilute regimes, including gelation
                  shows the very different physical properties of SLES
                  than that of its non-ethoxylated analogue and well
                  studied sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS).},

                  properties of aqueous solutions of
                  cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), with
                  salicylate (from NaSal) as the binding counterion,
                  are presented as a function of counterion
                  concentration. At low [Sal-], CTAC solutions form
                  globular (spherical) micelles (5 nm in diameter) and
                  behave as Newtonian fluids. With increasing [Sal-],
                  these solutions form threadlike or wormlike micelles
                  (5 nm in diameter with lengths as long as several
                  micrometers) that are viscoelastic and entangled. At
                  moderate [Sal-], these solutions have a spectrum of
                  relaxation times similar to semidilute polymer
                  solutions. At high [Sal-], a single relaxation time
                  dominates. The viscosity of the viscoelastic
                  solutions shows shear thinning and power law
                  behavior. As a function of [Sal-], the zero-shear
                  viscosity (eta(0)) reaches a maximum 5 orders of
                  magnitude greater than the initial viscosity of the
                  solution with no salicylate. With further increase
                  in [Sal-], the zero-shear viscosity then decreases 3
                  orders of magnitude. After the formation of
                  threadlike micelles, the rheological properties
                  change as a function of [Sal-], whereas the electron
                  micrographs all show similar images of entangled
                  threadlike micelles. Some of the images have a small
                  number of closed circular threadlike structures,
                  indicating the existence of ringlike
                  micelles. Samples for electron microscopy were
                  thermally fixed before and after relaxation. In some
                  cases, the samples imaged before relaxation revealed
                  the threadlike micelles in an ordered state due to
                  the shear induced during sample preparation.},

  Abstract = {This paper introduces a new mathematical model for a
                  dilute complex fluid based on a Hookean bead-spring
                  mechanism. The new model couples constitutive
                  equations with number density and includes bead
                  slippage which manifests itself in higher-order
                  corrections. In the case of simple shear flows, we
                  compute steady solutions and determine the linear
                  stability of this model along the flow curve. The
                  linear stability indicates a selection mechanism for
                  multi-valued regions of the flow curve in
                  stress-controlled experiments. We find that the
                  model provides a physically reasonable extension to
                  existing models and exhibits desirable properties
                  such as shear thinning and shear banding. Finally,
                  it predicts hysteretic behavior in the effective
                  viscosity qualitatively similar to that which has
                  been observed in laboratory experiments. (C) 2004

  Journal = PRE,

  Abstract = {With a view to understanding the rheochaos observed in
                  recent experiments in a variety of orientable
                  fluids, we study numerically the equations of motion
                  of the spatiotemporal evolution of the traceless
                  symmetric order parameter of a sheared nematogenic
                  fluid. In particular we establish, by decisive
                  numerical tests, that the irregular oscillatory
                  behavior seen in a region of parameter space where
                  the nematic is not stably flow-aligning is in fact
                  spatiotemporal chaos. We outline the dynamical phase
                  diagram of the model and study the route to the
                  chaotic state. We find that spatiotemporal chaos in
                  this system sets in via a regime of spatiotemporal
                  intermittency, with a power-law distribution of the
                  widths of laminar regions, as in H. Chate and
                  P. Manneville, Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 112
                  (1987). Further, the evolution of the histogram of
                  band sizes shows a growing length scale as one moves
                  from the chaotic towards the flow-aligned
                  phase. Finally we suggest possible experiments in
                  which one can observe the intriguing behaviors
                  discussed here.},

                  fluid with a single relaxation time. When submitted

  Abstract = {The rheo-optical behavior of a viscoelastic solution of
                  a surfactant subjected to transient shear flows is
                  reported. A steplike shear rate is suddenly imposed
                  and we record the transient physical characteristics
                  of the liquid, i.e., the shear stress sigma, the
                  transmitted intensity l(t), and the scattering
                  pattern. At the inception of the flow the shear
                  stress shows an important overshoot followed by
                  damped oscillations which also appear in the
                  intensity profile. Then a sigmoidal relaxation
                  process brings the liquid in its final steady
                  state. During this first phase, the diffusion
                  pattern due to enhanced concentration fluctuations
                  can also be observed. A fine anisotropic layer
                  appears near the moving wall shortly after the
                  inception of the flow, but its width starts to
                  increase significantly well after the end of the
                  relaxation process. When the laser beam travels
                  through this band a diffraction pattern can be
                  observed indicating that it is formed by small

                  contained in a Couette device and subjected to flow
                  in the strain controlled mode. This particular
                  solution shows shear banding and, in a narrow range
                  of shear rates at the right end of the stress
                  plateau, apparent shear thickening
                  occurs. Time-dependent recordings of the shear
                  stress in this range reveal that the flow has become
                  unstable and that large sustained oscillations of
                  the shear stress and of the first normal stresses
                  difference emerge and grow in the flow. Local
                  pointwise velocity measurements clearly reveal a
                  velocity profile typical of shear banding when the
                  imposed shear rate belongs to the plateau, but also
                  important wall slip in the entire range of velocity
                  gradients investigated. In the oscillations regime,
                  the velocity is recorded as a function of time at a
                  fixed point close to the rotor of the Couette
                  device. The time-dependent velocity profile reveals

                  decreases much larger than the standard deviation
                  are observed. An attempt is made to correlate these
                  strong variations with the stress oscillations and a
                  correlation coefficient r is computed. However, the
                  small value found for the coefficient r does not
                  allow us to draw a final conclusion as concerns the
                  correlation between stress oscillations and velocity

                  banding, i.e., a region of high shear rate
                  coexisting with a region of low shear rate. Our
                  experimental observations on one surfactant system
                  agree with the simple idea of a shear-induced
                  transition between a high and a low viscosity
                  'phase'. The detailed analysis of the velocity
                  profiles allows us to reach the conclusion that the
                  viscosities of the coexisting phases are those of
                  the homogeneous fluids that exist before and after
                  the stress plateau. The proportion of the
                  shear-induced phase grows in the same fashion as
                  that of the birefringent band, and the fraction of
                  the gap occupied by the shear-induced fluid is found
                  to follow a simple lever rule.},

                  concentration range. For the maltosides, the

                  zero-shear viscosity that scales with concentration
                  according to a power law with an exponent of about

                  fast-breaking regime, and exhibit shear banding
                  above a critical shear rate. When this ratio is

                  as having a flexible, elongated cylindrical
                  shape. Three structural scale lengths are pertinent
                  to the flexibility and mobility of worm micelles:
                  the cross-sectional radius, r(cs), the overall
                  (contour) length, L, and the persistence length,
                  l(p). The diversity of l(p) values in amphiphilic
                  systems is demonstrated as well as the relation
                  between L and l(p). The review also discusses the
                  viscoelasticity of worm micelles and the relaxation
                  mechanisms underlying this dominant property. Many
                  aspects of viscoelasticity - such as non-linearity,
                  shear banding, flow-induced phase transition,
                  rheochaos - are only shortly described. The
                  prevailing application of worm micelles, namely as
                  fracture fluids and drag reducing agents are
                  discussed in detail, stressing the effect of
                  variations in the surfactant molecular structure on
                  the efficacy of worm micelles. The vague possibility
                  of using smart worm micelles in the foreseeable
                  future is tersely outlined. (C) 2006 Elsevier

  Volume = {11},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {65-83},
  Abstract = {After surveying the experimental evidence for
                  concentration coupling in the shear banding of
                  wormlike micellar surfactant systems, we present
                  flow phase diagrams spanned by shear stress Sigma
                  (or strain rate (gamma) over dot) and concentration,
                  calculated within the two-fluid, non-local
                  Johnson-Segalman (d-JS-phi) model. We also give
                  results for the macroscopic flow curves Sigma(gamma
                  radical anion, (&phi;) over bar) for a range of
                  (average) concentrations (&phi;) over bar. For any
                  concentration that is high enough to give shear
                  banding, the flow curve shows the usual non-analytic
                  kink at the onset of banding, followed by a
                  coexistence plateau that slopes upwards,
                  dSigma/dgamma radical anion > 0. As the
                  concentration is reduced, the width of the
                  coexistence regime diminishes and eventually
                  terminates at a non-equilibrium critical point
                  [Sigma(c), (&phi;) over bar (c), gamma radical anion
                  (c)]. We outline the way in which the flow phase
                  diagram can be reconstructed from a family of such
                  flow curves, measured for several different values
                  of (&phi;) over bar. This reconstruction could be
                  used to check new measurements of concentration
                  differences between the coexisting bands. Our
                  d-JS-phi model contains two different spatial
                  gradient terms that describe the interface between
                  the shear bands. The first is in the viscoelastic
                  constitutive equation, with a characteristic (mesh)
                  length l. The second is in the (generalised)
                  Cahn-Hilliard equation, with the characteristic
                  length xi for equilibrium
                  concentration-fluctuations. We show that the phase
                  diagrams (and so also the flow curves) depend on the
                  ratio r = l/xi, with loss of unique state selection
                  at r = 0. We also give results for the full
                  shear-banded profiles, and study the divergence of
                  the interfacial width (relative to l and xi) at the
                  critical point.},

                  1998; Wheeler 1998; Fischer 2000), Within a
                  stability analysis, a classification scheme for the
                  feedback circuit of coupled shear-induced structure
                  and flow instabilities was derived by Schmitt et
                  al. (1995) and applied to our samples. Here,
                  inhomogeneous flow layers of different concentration
                  and viscosity are generated by shear-induced
                  diffusion (spinodal demixing) and, as consequence,
                  one no longer observes a homogeneous solution but a
                  type of shear banding that is seen here for the
                  first time. III this paper we present the behaviour
                  of the first normal stress difference observed in
                  the critical shear-rate regime where transient
                  shear-induced structure is coupled with flow
                  instability. Similar to the oscillations of the
                  shear stresses (strain-controlled rheometer) one
                  observes oscillations in the first normal stress
                  difference. This behaviour indicates that elastic
                  structures are built up and destroyed while the
                  shear-induced structures occur and that the induced
                  phase is more elastic than the initial
                  one. Oscillations of shear stress and first normal
                  stress difference are in phase and indicate that
                  both phenomena are caused by the same mechanism.},

  Abstract = {In this paper we present a study of the rheological
                  properties of aqueous cetylpyridinium
                  chloride/sodium salicylate solutions that have been
                  measured as a function of both sucrose concentration
                  and temperature. By using three different
                  superposition methods we evaluated the rheological
                  master curves for these solutions. In the
                  low-frequency regime the rheological behavior can be
                  described by a simple Maxwell material while in the
                  high-frequency regime the sample is characterized by
                  a Rouse-like behavior. Increasing the sucrose
                  concentration causes some structural changes of the
                  micelles to occur. In the Maxwellian part-of the
                  spectrum we always obtain a uniform master curve
                  independent-of the amount of added sucrose and the
                  temperature. Therefore in the limit of
                  monoexponential stress relaxation a complete linear
                  rheological description becomes possible by just
                  knowing the relaxation time and the zero shear
                  modulus of the solution. However, some deviations
                  from this picture are observed in the regime of high
                  frequencies and extremely high sucrose
                  concentrations. Here we observe a Rouse-like
                  spectrum and structural changes in the elongated
                  micelles due to the added sucrose.},

  Abstract = {This paper gives a quantitative description of the
                  viscoelastic properties of aqueous solutions of
                  entangled rod-shaped micelles. The experimental data
                  are compared with the theoretical predictions of a
                  special constitutive equation which is based on the
                  concept of deformation-dependent tensorial
                  mobility. In the regime of small deformations, shear
                  stresses or shear rates, the dynamic features of the
                  viscoelastic solutions are characterized by the
                  equations of a simple Maxwell material. These
                  phenomena are linked to the average lifetime of the
                  micellar aggregates and the rheological properties
                  are controlled by kinetic processes. At these
                  conditions one observes simple scaling laws and
                  linear relations between all rheological
                  quantities. At elevated values of shear stresses or
                  deformations, however, this simple model fails and
                  non-linear properties as normal stresses, stress
                  overshoots or shear-thinning properties occur. All
                  these phenomena can be described by a constitutive
                  equation which was first proposed by
                  H. Giesekus. The experimental results are in fairly
                  good agreement with the theoretical predictions, and
                  this model holds for a certain, well defined value
                  of the mobility factor alpha. This parameter
                  describes the anisotropic character of the particle
                  motion. In transient and steady-state flow
                  experiments we always observed alpha =
                  0.5. Especially at these conditions, the empirically
                  observed Cox-Merz rule, the Yamamoto relation and
                  both Gleissle mirror relations are automatically
                  derived from the Giesekus model. The phenomena
                  discussed in this paper are of general importance,
                  and can be equally observed in different materials,
                  such as polymers or proteins. The viscoelastic
                  surfactant solutions can, therefore, be used as
                  simple model systems for studies of fundamental
                  principles of flow.},

                  properties of polymer chains (Munstedt and Laun,
                  1981). They concluded that, in addition to the
                  molecular weight distribution, the degree of
                  branching strongly affects the degree of strain
                  thickening of the elongational viscosity in such a
                  way that the maximum in this material function
                  increases with branching. In a recent paper by Lin,
                  a ternary system of dodecyldimethylamine
                  oxide-sodium laureth sulphate-sodium chloride
                  surfactant solutions was investigated by CryoTEM and
                  rheology (Lin, 1996). He reported a linear relation
                  between the added sodium chloride and the branching
                  of the wormlike micelles. In this paper we present
                  an investigation of these surfactant solutions in

  Journal = RA,

  Abstract = {The non-monotonic shear flow of a viscoelastic equimolar
                  aqueous surfactant solution (cetylpyridinium
                  chloride-sodium salicylate) is investigated
                  rheologically and optically in a transparent
                  strain-controlled Taylor Couette flow cell. As
                  reported before, this particular wormlike micellar
                  solution exhibits first a shear thinning and then a
                  pronounced shear-thickening behavior. Once this
                  shear-thickening regime is reached, a transient
                  phase separation/shear banding of the solution into
                  turbid and clear ring-like patterns orientated
                  perpendicular to the vorticity axis, i.e., stacked
                  like pancakes, is observed (Wheeler et al. 1998;
                  Fischer 2000). The solution exhibit several unique
                  features as no induction period of the shear induced
                  phase, no structural buildup at the inner rotating
                  cylinder, jumping pancake structure of clear and
                  turbid ringlike phases, and oscillating shear
                  stresses appear once the pancake structure is
                  present. According to our analysis this flow
                  phenomenon is not purely a mechanical or rheological
                  driven hydrodynamic instability but one has to take
                  into account structural changes of the oriented
                  micellar aggregates (flow induced non-equilibrium
                  phase transition) as proposed by several
                  authors. Although this particular flow behavior and
                  the underlying mixture of shear induced phases and
                  mechanical instabilities is not fully understood
                  yet, some classification characteristics based on a
                  recent theoretical approach by Schmitt et al. (1995)
                  and Porte et al. (1997) where a strong coupling
                  between the flow instability (non-homogeneous flow
                  profile due to the bands) and the structural changes
                  causes the observed transient phenomena can be
                  derived. In reference to the presented model the
                  observed orientation of the rings is typical for
                  complex fluids that undergo a spinodal phase
                  separation coupled with a thermodynamic flow
                  instability. In contrast to other shear banding
                  phenomena, this one is observed in parallel plate,
                  cone-plate, and Couette flow cell as well as under
                  controlled stress and controlled rate
                  conditions. Therefore, it adds an additional aspect
                  to the present discussion on shear banding
                  phenomena, i.e., the coupling of hydrodynamics and
                  phase transition of theological complex fluids.},

                  measurement of dynamics of materials on mesoscopic
                  lengthscales. One of the most common problems
                  associated with the use of bright x-ray beams is
                  beam-induced radiation damage, and this is likely to
                  become an even more limiting factor at future
                  synchrotron and free-electron laser sources. Flowing
                  the sample during data acquisition is one of the
                  simplest methods allowing the radiation damage to be
                  limited. In addition to distributing the dose over
                  many different scatterers, the method also enables
                  new functionalities such as time-resolved
                  studies. Here, we further develop a recently
                  proposed experimental technique that combines XPCS
                  and continuously flowing samples. More specifically,
                  we use a model colloidal suspension to show how the
                  macroscopic advective response to flow and the
                  microscopic dissipative dynamics (diffusion) can be
                  quantified from the x-ray data.  Our results show
                  very good quantitative agreement with a
                  Poisseuille-flow hydrodynamical model combined with
                  Brownian mechanics.  The method has many potential
                  applications, e. g. in the study of dynamics of
                  glasses and gels under continuous shear/flow,
                  protein aggregation processes and the interplay

                  the micellar recombination kinetics in this system
                  is diffusion-controlled ( micelles break and
                  recombine with their original partners). Addition of
                  10 mM to 100 mM of sodium chloride ( NaCl), takes
                  the system from the diffusion-controlled ( DC)
                  regime to mean-field recombination kinetics regime
                  where micellar ends combine with ends belonging to
                  other micelles. In the mean-field regime, the
                  concentration fluctuations decay in a purely
                  diffusive manner. We suggest a qualitative
                  explanation for the observed superdiffusive
                  behaviour in the DC regime.},

  Abstract = {We present our recent experiments on the nonlinear
                  dynamics in the flow behaviour of shear-thinning
                  wormlike micellar gels. In particular, we have shown
                  experimentally that above a critical shear rate, the
                  initial transient stress response comprises of
                  overshoots and undershoots and this is followed by
                  periodic, quasiperiodic, intermittent and chaotic
                  behaviour. The normal force dynamics is similar to
                  that of the stress. This can be classified as
                  Type-II intermittency route to chaos. In our system,
                  shear-thinning wormlike micellar solution of
                  cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate, the strength of
                  flow-concentration coupling is tuned by the addition
                  of salt sodium chloride. The existence of a
                  butterfly intensity pattern in small angle light
                  scattering (SALS) performed simultaneously with the
                  theological measurements confirms the coupling of
                  flow to concentration fluctuations in the system
                  under study. Dynamic light scattering measurements
                  to extract the relaxation time scales of
                  concentration fluctuations are in excellent
                  agreement with the in situ SALS measurements
                  performed under shear. The scattered depolarised
                  intensity in SALS, sensitive to orientational order
                  fluctuations, shows the same time-dependence (like
                  intermittency) as that of shear stress at various
                  wave vectors. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

                  subject to homogeneous states of shearing, a
                  research field that is scarcely two decades old. For
                  the benefit of fluid mechanicians, a brief, somewhat
                  historical overview is presented of material
                  instability in elastoplastic solids, where one finds
                  a considerable body of experiment and a rich source
                  of theoretical concepts including Hadamard
                  instability, strain localization, and nonlocal
                  constitutive models. A survey is then given of
                  recent theoretical and experimental studies of
                  instability with shear banding in various complex
                  fluids, including micellar solutions, particulate
                  suspensions, and rapidly sheared granular
                  media. Various stability analyses are encapsulated
                  in a mathematical dynamical-systems model for
                  constitutive equations of the rate-type, and a
                  general linear-stability theory is given for
                  viscoelastic fluids in unbounded homogeneous shear
                  flows. A general form of (Kelvin) wave-vector
                  stretching is shown to play a key role in the growth
                  of Fourier modes, as illustrated by recent
                  computations for granular shear flow. The Fourier
                  description also provides an explicit representation
                  of higher-gradient (nonlocal) effects as
                  higher-order powers of wave number.},

                  example, drag-reducing agents or viscosity

                  on the morphology and interactions between the
                  micelles, both of which can be tuned by changing
                  solution conditions. Although there has been
                  extensive theoretical study of these solutions,
                  there are often conflicting explanations, or no

                  (cryo-TEM) for the direct visualization of the

  Abstract = {A general phenomenological reaction-diffusion model for
                  flow-induced phase transitions in complex fluids is
                  presented. The model consists of an equation of
                  motion for a nonconserved composition variable,
                  coupled to a Newtonian stress relation for the
                  reactant and product species. Multivalued reaction
                  terms allow for different homogeneous phases to
                  coexist with each other, resulting in banded
                  composition and shear rate profiles. The
                  one-dimensional equation of motion is evolved from a
                  random initial state to its final steady state. We

Abstract = {{The steady-state nonlinear rheology of wormlike micellar
                  systems is thought to be subject to shear banding
                  (the underlying shear stress vs.  strain rate curve
                  sigma((gamma))over dot is nonmonotonic). Shear
                  banding may result in a plateau (sigma((gamma))over
                  dot = sigma(p)) in the measured flow curve (at
                  controlled mean strain rate (gamma)over dot). We
                  present new rheological data for aqueous CPyCl/NaSal
                  (100 mM/60 mM). Steady-state flow curves published
                  previously for this system (Rehage H. and Hoffmann
                  H., Mol. Phys. 74 (1991) 933) have since been
                  interpreted as shear banded flow with
                  `'top-jumping'', in which the steady-state shear
                  rate (gamma)over dot(1) in the low shear band is the
                  largest possible ((gamma))over dot(1) = (gamma)over
                  dot(1)(max), sigma(p), = sigma(max)). That would
                  rule out the existence of a metastable branch with a
                  stress larger than a,. We show that such a branch
                  does, however, exist (for temperatures in the range
                  20 - 25 degrees C). Similar results are found for a
                  100 mM/75 mM system. The time scale for relaxation
                  of a metastable state onto true steady state flow,
                  tau(ss), is far longer than the Maxwell time of the
                  fluid; this is consistent with shear banding. We
                  observe tau(ss) similar to ((gamma)over dot -
                  (gamma)(c))(-p) in the metastable regime
                  ((gamma)over dot greater than or equal to
                  (gamma)(1)), with p an exponent that depends on
                  composition and temperature. The `'critical'' shear
                  rate (gamma)(c) is in some cases less than
                  (gamma)over dot(1) so that no actual divergence of
                  tau(ss) occurs. In at least one case, though, there
                  is evidence for a physical divergence ((gamma)over
                  dot(c) > (gamma)over dot(1)) accompanied by a small
                  window of shear rates, (gamma)over dot(1) less than
                  or equal to (gamma)over dot less than or equal to
                  (gamma)over dot(c), for which tau(ss) is effectively
                  infinite.  In some respects the observed behaviour
                  resembles that reported previously (Berret J.-F.,
                  Roux D.C. and Forte G.; J. Phys. II France 4 (1994)
                  1261) for equimolar CPyCl/NaSal in 0.5 M NaCL. Those
                  results were interpreted in terms of nucleation and
                  growth of a shear-induced nematic phase. However the
                  same explanation is unlikely for the low weight
                  fractions (phi less than or equal to 5\%) used in
                  our study.}},

  Abstract = {We examine the behaviour in shear of a viscoelastic
                  fluid model (Johnson-Segalman fluid plus a Newtonian
                  contribution) which exhibits a constitutive
                  instability with respect to shear banding. Because
                  there is a range of stress values at which shear
                  bands can coexist, it is not clear which value of
                  the stress is attained at a given, nominal shear
                  rate, nor whether a selection of some particular
                  value for the stress throughout the unstable range
                  of shear rates exists or not. In this paper, al
                  least for the specific fluid considered, we show
                  that (i) a phase-separated flow actually occurs, and
                  (ii) a selection mechanism for the stress in the
                  shear-banded regime does exist. To obtain these
                  clear-cut results, we used the Couette concentric
                  cylinder geometry, where a 'seed' for the phase
                  separation is automatically provided by the
                  curvature: the portion of the material which is near
                  to the inner (moving) cylinder is more strongly
                  sheared than any other portion, and can induce the
                  formation of a high shear rate band. At steady
                  state, the existence of a selection mechanism for
                  the stress implies that the 'volume fraction' of the
                  high shear rate phase (not its shear rate) increases
                  by increasing the velocity of the moving
                  cylinder. These and other features of our computed
                  solutions resemble experimental observations. We
                  conclude the paper by showing how a simple
                  variational reasoning can help in locating the
                  selected stress. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   Abstract = {{Turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is not
                  fully understood. It is known that the flow of a
                  simple, newtonian fluid is likely to be turbulent
                  when the Reynolds number is large (typically when
                  the velocity is high, the viscosity is low and the
                  size of the tank is large(1,2)). In contrast,
                  viscoelastic fluids(3) such as solutions of flexible
                  long-chain polymers have nonlinear mechanical
                  properties and therefore may be expected to behave
                  differently. Here we observe experimentally that the
                  flow of a sufficiently elastic polymer solution can
                  become irregular even at low velocity, high
                  viscosity and in a small tank. The fluid motion is
                  excited in a broad range of spatial and temporal
                  scales, and we observe an increase in the flow
                  resistance by a factor of about twenty. Although the
                  Reynolds number may be arbitrarily low, the observed
                  flow has all the main features of developed
                  turbulence. A comparable state of turbulent flow for
                  a newtonian fluid in a pipe would have a Reynolds
                  number as high as 10(5) (refs 1, 2).  The low
                  Reynolds number or `elastic' turbulence that we
                  observe is accompanied by significant stretching of
                  the polymer molecules, resulting in an increase in
                  the elastic stresses of up to two orders of
                  magnitude.}},

                  angle light scattering (SALS) experiments are
                  carried out in the flow through a slit cell. In the

                  Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and Sodium
                  Salicylate (NaSal) are used. The flow curve has a
                  break point and its slope below the bending point
                  significantly depends on the ratio of salt
                  concentration C-S to surfactant concentration
                  C-D. From the experiments on the effect of capillary
                  diameter, it is found that eqimolar solution for C-D
                  = 0.03M exhibits a remarkable diameter dependence
                  below the break point while the solution for C-D =

                  dependence only in a narrow region at intermediate
                  shear rates. In the SALS experiments the butterfly
                  pattern is observed for C-S/C-D = 1 and the
                  four-fold symmetry pattern for C-S/C-D = 7.7. The
                  characteristic scattering pattern is destroyed just
                  after the startup of the flow at high shear rates
                  where the flow curves overlaps regardless of salt
                  concentration and length and diameter of
                  capillary. This fact suggests that micellar network
                  structures are broken at the high shear rates.},

                  indicate the formation of very long elongated
                  wormlike micelles at temperatures higher than about
                  50 degrees C, conferring to the system a very high
                  viscosity. This behavior is explained by the
                  combined effect of a large end cap energy and a low
                  ionization degree resulting from a strong binding of
                  the weakly soluble counterions. At lower temperature

                  and cetyl trimethylammonium 3-hydroxy naphthalene
                  2-carboxylate (CTAHNC) to understand the effect of
                  hydrophobicity of the counterions on the structure
                  of aggregates formed. The total surfactant
                  concentration is fixed at 100 mM, and the ratio of
                  the two counterions HNC- to tosylate(-) (x(2)) is
                  varied from 0 to 0.7. The zero shear viscosity (eta)
                  and the terminal time of stress relaxation (tau(R))
                  initially increases slowly with x(2) and then
                  decreases drastically for x(2) > 0.5. The initial
                  increase of both eta and tau(R) can be explained by
                  an increase of the micellar length owing to the more
                  hydrophobicity of HNC-, which reduces the scission
                  energy of the micelles due to the decrease of the
                  electrostatic contribution. A decrease of the eta
                  and tau(R) above x(2) = 0.5 is attributed to the
                  formation of intermicellar connections, which is
                  favored at very high salt content. The presence of
                  intermicellar branching speeds up the reptation
                  process and decreases the average micellar lengths
                  thereby reducing eta and tau(R). Analysis of the
                  data by the theory of Cates suggests that increasing
                  the fraction of HNC- increases the rate of
                  entanglement length to the contour length of the
                  micelles. This is consistent with the temperature
                  dependence of the rheological data. The present
                  investigation supports the earlier observation that
                  branched micelles constitute the intermediate
                  structures between linear micelles and bilayers.},

                  X-ray and neutron scattering, and pulse-gradient NMR
                  measurements points to a progressive change in
                  surfactant microstructure across the concentration
                  range. This change is parallel to the progression of
                  liquid crystal phase behavior at lower
                  temperatures. The results are interpreted in terms
                  of a model in which small spherical micelles formed
                  at low concentrations transform progressively to
                  entangled worm-like micelles, branched
                  interconnected worm-like micelles, and then a random
                  bilayer structure which persists to 100\%
                  surfactant.},

                  solutions was studied in detail. Flow curves
                  obtained with capillaries of different sizes for
                  surfactant aqueous solutions at various
                  concentrations, were analyzed with particular
                  attention to the regions of flow instability. It was
                  found that to observe unstable flow a critical
                  residence time of the solution in the capillary is
                  needed, in addition to a critical shear stress
                  value. At specific surfactant concentrations, a
                  plateau-like; region was observed for sufficiently
                  long residence times of the liquid under flow,
                  either in the capillary or in a cone and plate
                  rheometer. For shear rates higher than those of the
                  plateau region, the expected upturn on the flow
                  curves was observed and studied. The flow curves in
                  this regime were dependent on the capillary diameter
                  in an opposite way as found in the presence of slip,
                  i.e., adherence appears to occur. The flow
                  instabilities (observed as unstable pressure at the
                  capillary entrance and a variable flow rate at the
                  exit) were detected even for the lowest
                  concentration solution where the plateau region was
                  not apparent. The flow instabilities took place
                  completely in the absence of slip. A remarkable
                  effect was observed in the solution with the higher
                  surfactant concentration using a flow system that
                  allows long residence rimes (about 1 h). In this
                  case, within a small window of shear stresses, a
                  dramatic increase in flow rate accompanied by a
                  large drop in the pressure measured at the capillary
                  entrance was observed. After a minimum, the pressure
                  increased again up to the initial stress and a new
                  cycle began subsequently. This result is consistent
                  with similar observations made in cone and plate or
                  Couette geometries, which are attributed to the
                  presence of 'shear bands'. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

  Abstract = {We have studied shear banding in Couette flow using a
                  combination of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV),
                  small angle light scattering, microscopic
                  visualization, and flow birefringence. Time-resolved
                  local shear rate characterization by PTV has enabled
                  a direct study of the kinetics of shear banding. A
                  first stage, which precedes banding, is tilting of
                  the shear rate during which the local shear rate
                  increases towards the inner and decreases towards
                  the outer gap surface. A shear banding stage then
                  proceeds with a low shear band growing away from the
                  outer gap surface. Shear rate tilting is found to be
                  due to a coupling of local shear thinning with the
                  nonzero stress gradient of the flow geometry. The
                  low shear band starts when the local shear rate at
                  the outer surface touches down to a critical
                  reentanglement shear rate. The effective lifetime of
                  the shear bands is the same as the chain
                  reentanglement time. These factors lead us to
                  suggest that both the progression from tilt to shear
                  banding and the interface between the low and high
                  shear bands are subject to a common local
                  entanglement/disentanglement criterion. Constitutive
                  curves constructed from local shear rates show that
                  there is not a unique stress-the shear rate relation
                  in the shear band coexistence regime, suggesting
                  constitutive instability. The high shear band has
                  fluctuating micellar layers aligned in the flow
                  direction, and is strongly shear thinning. We
                  observe insignificant viscosity differences between
                  adjacent layers, and layer relaxation times are an
                  order of magnitude greater than the effective
                  lifetime of the shear bands. The layers, therefore,
                  do not behave as subshear bands and are not
                  causative for the shear banding. (C) 2005 The

                  salt (potassium chloride, KCl). Both salts promote
                  the growth of long, wormlike micelles in NaOA
                  solutions, thereby increasing the fluid
                  viscosity. The significant difference with the
                  Et3NHCl salt is that it also modifies the phase
                  behavior of NaOA solutions. Specifically,
                  NaOA/Et3NHCl solutions display cloud points upon

                  experimental data has been achieved in predicting
                  tilt transition, tilt angle and direction. A level
                  of sophistication of simulations has been attained
                  whereby perfect agreement with experiments is
                  pursued on complex issues such as the ordering of
                  the chain backbones in various monolayer phases. For
                  bilayers, most relevant time scales may still be
                  just outside the reach of standard molecular
                  dynamics simulations; nevertheless, ingenious
                  computational techniques that go beyond standard
                  molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have
                  enabled much faster progress than previously

  Abstract = {In this article, we consider the effects of sodium
                  salicylate on the microstructure evolution and
                  rheological responses of an aqueous
                  cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. The
                  experimental runs covered CTAB solutions ranging
                  from dilute to semidilute, which were far above its
                  critical micelle concentration. Sodium salicylate
                  (NaSal) was used as a structure-forming agent with
                  the molar ratio of NaSal to CTAB ranging from 0.1 to
                  10.0. The experimental results showed that the
                  rheological responses of the surfactant solution
                  were influenced strongly by both the CTAB
                  concentration and the molar ratio. At low molar
                  ratios, below 0.3, the surfactant solutions behaved
                  like a Newtonian fluid. However, as the molar ratio
                  increased, the deviation from Newtonian behavior
                  became pronounced. Specifically, for 0.05 M CTAB
                  solutions with molar ratios ranging from 1.0 to 5.0,
                  an apparent yield stress developed at low shear
                  rates and a stress plateau was displayed at
                  intermediate shear rates. When the shear rate
                  exceeded a certain threshold value, the shear stress
                  increased, again passing over the plateau value. In
                  addition, viscoelastic response and relaxation
                  behavior were observed. The relaxation behavior
                  after the cessation of flow was strongly dependent
                  on the molar ratio, which was also confirmed by
                  rheo-optical observations. The optical anisotropy
                  measured by rheo-optical methods was closely related
                  to flow-induced stretching and alignment of the
                  wormy micelles and was consistent with the
                  rheological responses. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

                  polyelectrolyte nature of the micelles and the
                  increased chain flexibility caused by the rising

                  relaxation time and viscosity. Upon heating to
                  degrees 60 degrees C, however, the sample begins to
                  respond like a viscoelastic solution; that is, the
                  relaxation time and zero-shear viscosity become
                  finite, and the rheology approaches that of a
                  Maxwell fluid. The same pattern of behavior is
                  repeated at higher EDAB concentrations. Cryo-TEM and
                  SANS reveal the presence of giant wormlike micelles
                  in all EDAB samples at room temperature. The results
                  imply that, depending on temperature, EDAB wormlike
                  micelles can exhibit either a gel-like response or
                  the classical viscoelastic (Maxwellian)
                  response. The unusual gel-like behavior of EDAB
                  micelles at low temperatures is postulated to be the
                  result of very long micellar breaking times, which,
                  in turn, may be due to the long hydrophobic tails of
                  the surfactant.},

  Abstract = {The impact dynamics of water drops on thin films of
                  viscoelastic wormlike micelle solutions is
                  experimentally studied using a high-speed digital
                  video camera at frame rates up to 4000 frame/s. The
                  composition and thickness of the thin film is
                  modified to investigate the effect of fluid rheology
                  on the evolution of crown growth, the formation of
                  satellite droplets and the formation of the
                  Worthington jet. The experiments are performed using
                  a series of wormlike micelle solutions composed of a
                  surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),
                  and a salt, sodium salicylate (Nasal), in deionized
                  water. The linear viscoelastic shear rheology of the
                  wormlike micelle solutions is well described by a
                  Maxwell model with a single relaxation time while
                  the steady shear rheology is found to shear thin
                  quite heavily. In transient homogeneous uniaxial
                  extension, the wormlike micelle solutions
                  demonstrate significant strain hardening. The size
                  and velocity of the impacting drop is varied to
                  study the relative importance of Weber, Ohnesorge,
                  and Deborah numbers on the impact dynamics. The
                  addition of elasticity to the thin film fluid is
                  found to suppress the crown growth and the formation
                  of satellite drops with the largest effects observed
                  at small film thicknesses. A new form of the
                  splashing threshold is postulated which accounts for
                  the effects of viscoelasticity and collapses the
                  satellite droplet data onto a single master curve
                  dependent only on dimensionless film thickness and
                  the underlying surface roughness. Additionally, a
                  plateau is observed in the growth of the maximum
                  height of the Worthington jet height with increasing
                  impact velocity. It is postulated that the complex
                  behavior of the Worthington jet growth is the result
                  of a dissipative mechanism stemming from the
                  scission of wormlike micelles. (C) 2004 Elsevier

                  transition at which the apparent viscosity jumps to
                  a much higher value due to the formation of
                  shear-induced structures. However, the behavior of
                  the normal-stress differences N-1 and N-2 has not
                  been studied at the low-shear rates and shear
                  stresses ( < 0.1 Pa) at which shear thickening
                  occurs in most of the commonly studied systems, such
                  as aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium
                  bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSS). For
                  dilute equimolar solutions of CTAB/NaSS, the
                  validity of measurements of the shear flow
                  properties eta, N-1 and N-2 via cone-and-plate
                  rheometry is assessed by systematically varying the
                  cone angle, and by measuring the pressure profile
                  during cone-and-plate flows. The dependence on the
                  cone angle of the apparent viscosity value is
                  consistent with a stratified fluid structure, as
                  shown to occur in Couette rheometers by Hu and
                  co-workers [Hu, Y. T. et al., J. Rheol. 42,
                  1209-1226 (1998)]. However, N-1 and N-2 values show
                  no obvious dependence on cone angle, and the
                  occurrence of flow stratification is surprisingly
                  difficult to detect from the pressure profile. As
                  the shear rate is increased, the measured pressure
                  profiles are suggestive of a gradual
                  transition. from viscometric to nonviscometric
                  flow. By combining the results presented here with
                  earlier results by Huang and co-workers [Huang,
                  C.-M. et al., in Proceedings of the XII
                  International Conference on Rheology, edited by
                  A. Ait-Kadi et al. (Canadian Rheology Group, Quebec
                  City, 1996)], we conclude that: the same wormy
                  micelle solution exhibits at least two flow
                  transitions: that might be described as shear
                  thickening. In the shear-rate range of viscometric
                  cone-and-plate flows, the measured normal-stress
                  ratio -N-2/N-1 for dilute solutions of CTAB/NaSS
                  wormy micelles is similar to the value observed for
                  moderately entangled solutions of synthetic
                  polymers. (C) 2002 The Society of Rheology.},

                  mineral salt, 1.79 M sodium nitrate, subjected to
                  different steplike shear rates. This solution, which
                  can be described in the regime of small deformations
                  by the Maxwell model with a single relaxation time
                  (tau(R)), shows a stress plateau in the experimental
                  flow curve (sigma(gamma)) beyond a critical shear
                  rate gamma(cl). This behavior, characteristic of a
                  system undergoing a phase transition of the shear
                  banding type, is corroborated by steady-state flow
                  birefringence experiments. The transient shear
                  stress profiles (sigma(t)) recorded after the
                  startup of flow are very similar to those previously
                  published on the cetylpyridinium chloride/sodium
                  salycilate system. Just after the inception of the
                  flow, sigma quickly increases with time and then
                  relaxes toward its stationary value. This relaxation
                  mechanism occurs on two different time scales and
                  has been interpreted as follows: for duration on the
                  order of a few TR, the purely mechanical response of
                  the fluid is observed (overshoot and eventually
                  damped oscillations), while for t much greater than
                  tau(R), a long sigmoidal decay toward the plateau
                  value occurs, which is typical of nucleation and
                  growth of shear-induced phase
                  processes. Time-dependent measurements of the
                  birefringence intensity and the extinction angle
                  confirm the existence of such an evolution. However,
                  direct visualization of the gap shows that the
                  growth of the induced phase is not associated with
                  the behavior of the stretched exponential, since it
                  occurs after the steady state in stress and optical
                  anisotropy is achieved. The spatial distribution of
                  the transmitted light intensity through the gap
                  indicates that the flow is locally nonhomogeneous:
                  the shear-induced band is made up of small sub-bands
                  closely aligned in the flow direction.}},

                  well-defined stress plateau, characteristic of a
                  flow of the shear-banding type. We first focus on
                  the rheological and rheo-optical transient response
                  of the sample after the sudden start-up of flow. The
                  time-dependent stress profiles are strongly similar
                  to those observed on various other systems with the
                  occurrence of an overshoot at short times followed
                  by a stretched exponential relaxation toward the
                  steady state on a long time scale. This behavior is
                  then correlated to the temporal evolution of the
                  birefringence intensity and the extinction angle;
                  the latter exhibits an undershoot just after the
                  inception of the flow. Using direct visualizations
                  of the sheared sample and spatially resolved flow
                  birefringence accross the gap of the Couette cell,
                  we have been able to highlight a peculiar banding
                  structure made up of three distinct regions: two
                  layers of homogeneous but strongly differing
                  orientations located against the walls, separated by
                  a mixed layer, the width of which can reach half of
                  the gap as a function of the effective applied shear
                  rate. The induced structures contained in the band
                  adjacent to the inner moving cylinder are found to
                  be almost fully aligned along the flow
                  direction. The relative proportions of each region
                  are derived from the orientation profiles and
                  compared to the predictions of the lever rule. The
                  results suggest that orientation bands and shear
                  bands are not linked in an obvious way, and the
                  observed band structure can finally be interpreted
                  as the coexistence either of three distinct phases
                  or of only two homogeneous phases separated by an
                  interface which can be broad, or thin and
                  fluctuating.},

                  scattering (SALS) experiments. The isotropic phase
                  behaved like a Newtonian liquid. An increase of
                  activation energy of viscous flow was found near the
                  overlap concentration of spherical micelles, but no
                  shear thinning was observed. The viscosity of low
                  concentrated samples increased slightly when the
                  lower critical solution temperature was
                  approached. This increase of viscosity was much
                  smaller compared to common nonionic surfactants. The
                  cubic phases behaved as elastic solids with a high
                  plateau modulus, and shear melting occurred at high
                  shear stresses. The hexagonal phase showed complex
                  behavior. Shear orientation could be achieved by
                  large amplitude oscillatory shear and was proved by
                  rheo-small-angle light scattering. Two orientations
                  were observed, at first perpendicular to the flow
                  direction, i.e., log-rolling state and, secondly, an
                  in-shear-plane orientation parallel to the flow
                  direction. The linear viscoelastic region of the
                  hexagonal phase was extremely small and was detected
                  by simultaneous rheo-small angle light
                  scattering. Shear alignment lead to a decrease of

                  predicted by the modeling of the relaxation
                  spectrum. The modeled spectrum of relaxation times
                  is of the ''wedge-box'' type where the ''wedge''
                  portion is located at the short-time scale of
                  relaxation times and the ''box'' part covers the
                  longtime scale. The linear viscoelastic properties
                  are calculated through the exact relationships with
                  the suggested spectrum. Agreement between the
                  calculated expressions and experimental data of the
                  moduli and the stress relaxation function is
                  found. Comparison is also made with predictions of
                  the empirical expressions of the Cole-Cole and the
                  Williams-Watts models.},

                  measure velocity profiles in a complex fluid sheared

                  time-domain cross-correlation of ultrasonic speckle
                  signals backscattered by the moving
                  medium. Post-processing of acoustic data allows us

                  spatial resolution of 40 mum over 1 mm. After a
                  careful calibration using a Newtonian suspension,

                  lamellar phase seeded with polystyrene spheres of

                  both wall slip and shear bands, in the vicinity of a

                  associated with the apparition of a stress plateau
                  in the flow curve. (i) At T=37.0 degrees C < T-c,
                  the bulk flow remains homogeneous and
                  Newtonian-like, although significant wall slip is

  Abstract = {The shear-thickening behavior of an equimolar semidilute
                  aqueous solution of 40 mM/L cetylpyridinium chloride
                  and sodium salicylate was studied in this work by
                  using a combined method of rheometry and particle
                  image velocimetry (PIV). Experiments were conducted
                  at 27.5 degrees C with Couette, vane-bob, and
                  capillary rheometers in order to explore a wide
                  shear stress range as well as the effect of boundary
                  conditions and time of flow on the creation and
                  destruction of shear-induced structures (SIS). The
                  use of the combined method of capillary rheometry
                  with PIV allowed the detection of fast spatial and
                  temporal variations in the flow kinematics, which
                  are related to the shear-thickening behavior and the
                  dynamics of the SIS but are not distinguished by
                  pure rheometrical measurements. A rich-in-details
                  flow curve was found for this solution, which
                  includes five different regimes. Namely, at very low
                  shear rates a Newtonian behavior was found, followed
                  by a shear thinning one in the second regime. In the
                  third, shear banding was observed, which served as a
                  precursor of the SIS and shear-thickening. The
                  fourth and fifth regimes in the flow curve were
                  separated by a spurtlike behavior, and they clearly
                  evidenced the existence of shear-thickening
                  accompanied by stick-slip oscillations at the wall
                  of the rheometer, which subsequently produced
                  variations in the shear rate under shear stress
                  controlled flow. Such a stick-slip phenomenon
                  prevailed up to the highest shear stresses used in
                  this work and was reflected in asymmetric velocity
                  profiles with spatial and temporal variations linked
                  to the dynamics of creation and breakage of the
                  SIS. The presence of apparent slip at the wall of
                  the rheometer provides an energy release mechanism
                  which leads to breakage of the SIS, followed by
                  their further reformation during the stick part of
                  the cycles. In addition, PIV measurements allowed
                  the detection of apparent slip at the wall, as well
                  as mechanical failures in the bulk of the fluid,
                  which suggests an extra contribution of the shear
                  stress field to the SIS dynamics. Increasing the
                  residence time of the fluid in the flow system
                  enhanced the shear-thickening behavior. Finally, the
                  flow kinematics is described in detail and the true
                  flow curve is obtained, which only partially fits
                  into the scheme of existing theoretical models for
                  shear-thickening solutions.},

                  including the transition to the high shear branch
                  because of spurt. The velocity profiles at low shear
                  rates exhibited a Newtonian behavior, followed by a
                  still Newtonian with apparent slip up to the onset
                  of spurt. There was a jump of one order of magnitude
                  in the shear rate with a transient of a few minutes

                  obtained during the transition to the high shear
                  rate branch were plug-like, with a large increase in
                  the velocity close to the capillary wall. When the
                  transition was completed, the velocity profiles
                  corresponding to the high shear rate branch showed
                  the development of a shear band close to the
                  capillary wall, whose thickness increased along with
                  the shear rate. Finally, the true flow curve

                  conformations of the chains are found to elongate in
                  flow direction and shrink perpendicular to it while
                  the average polymer length decreases with increasing
                  shear rate. The Molecular Weight Distribution of the
                  chain lengths retains largely its exponential form
                  in dense solutions whereas in dilute solutions it
                  changes from a power-exponential Schwartz
                  distribution to a purely exponential one upon an
                  increase of the shear rate, With growing shear rate
                  the system becomes increasingly inhomogeneous so

  Journal = JNNFM,
  Volume = {143},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {22-37},
  Note = {Miller, Erik Rothstein, Jonathan P.},
  Abstract = {A series of experiments were performed to further
                  investigate the phenomenon of shear-banding in
                  surfactant solutions. Many surfactant solutions,
                  through their unique amphiphilic chemistry, form
                  long wormlike micelle structures which behave like
                  living polymers. These wormlike micelles have
                  interesting viscoelastic properties and have been
                  the subject of a number of recent studies. These
                  water-based surfactant systems are widely used in
                  many commercial and industrial applications;
                  however, many aspects of their complex flow behavior
                  are still not fully understood. In this study, a
                  Couette cell was designed to allow for
                  high-resolution optical access in a simple shear
                  flow of a surfactant system comprised of
                  cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate in
                  aqueous sodium chloride. Beyond a critical stress,
                  this system is found to enter a non-linear regime in
                  which there is a plateau in the shear stress with
                  increasing shear rate. Within this plateau, the
                  fluid forms distinct bands of varying shear
                  rate. The goal of this study was to obtain high
                  spatial and temporal resolution particle-image
                  velocimetry and flow-induced birefringence results
                  in both steady and transient-startup flows. As a
                  consequence of the high resolution, steady PIV
                  results suggest the existence of multiple-shear
                  bands. In the transient PIV experiments, we observe
                  a propagating damped elastic wave, as well as
                  fluctuations in the shear-band evolution on
                  timescales of less than one relaxation
                  time. Pointwise FIB gap profiles show a diffuse
                  birefringent region prior to the onset of
                  shear-banding in the velocity profiles. These
                  results provide insight on the flow behavior, as
                  well as a full set of experimental data which will
                  drive development of constitutive models capable of
                  predicting shear-banding. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

  Abstract = {Shear flow has been shown experimentally to lead to

                  polymer solutions near to their coexistence
                  curves. I develop a dynamical theory of
                  concentration fluctuations coupled to polymer
                  elastic stress, in terms of a ''two-fluid'' model of
                  polymer plus solvent. At first order in shear rate
                  gamma, only one component of the stress is coupled
                  to the concentration. The structure factor S
                  (q;gamma) is given as a ''history integral'' over
                  thermal-noise amplitudes at wave numbers convected
                  onto q. The characteristic wave number q*, at which
                  concentration fluctuations relax in a
                  stress-relaxation time, determines (1) the length
                  scale for the mixing of modes as observed in the
                  dynamic light scattering of quiescent solutions, and
                  (2) the length scale of peaks observed in static
                  light scattering under shear. Both features depend
                  on treating stress dynamics beyond an adiabatic
                  approximation. At O(gamma2), the spinodal is shifted
                  to higher (lower) temperatures for fluctuations in
                  the gradient (vorticity) direction.},

  Abstract = {It is well-known that solutions of
                  cetyltrimethylammonium p-toluenesulfonate in water
                  exhibit a pronounced shear-thickening phenomenon in
                  a specific concentration range (0.1-0.8\%) when they
                  are subjected to simple-shear flows, as a
                  consequence of flow-induced self-assembly of
                  wormlike micelles. This work shows that a strong
                  elongational flow field (opposed-jets flow), applied
                  to the same solutions, does not lead to extension
                  thickening because the extensional flow prevents or
                  destroys micellar association. In flow through a
                  porous medium, a substantial increase in apparent
                  viscosity is observed beyond a critical apparent
                  shear rate, which surpasses increases observed in
                  simple-shear flows. This is explained as the result
                  of a synergistic effect of shear and relatively weak
                  elongation on the solution microstructure.},

                  experiments on a sheared 5 mM aqueous surfactant
                  solution of trimethyltetradecylammonium salicylate
                  (TTMA-Sal) are reported. The radially symmetric
                  scattering pattern without shear shows a weak
                  ringlike correlation ''peak''. For steady shear
                  rates above a threshold value of GAMMA(th) = 50 s-1,
                  the scattering pattern becomes rapidly anisotropic
                  and the ring is compressed into two sharp, symmetric
                  peaks. These changes are related to a shear-induced
                  structural transition. The analysis of the data
                  reveals the existence of two different types of
                  micelles: Short rodlike micelles (called type I) are
                  always present, and they are only weakly
                  aligned. Very long rodlike micelles (named type II)
                  can be observed only above the threshold value of
                  GAMMA, and they are strongly aligned. Both types of
                  micelles are assumed to be of cylindrical shape,
                  with a radius R = 1.94 +/- 0.07 nm. We report the
                  results on three time-dependent SANS experiments,
                  where the shear rate was raised stepwise from zero
                  to a value of GAMMA(ex) = 100, 200, and 400 s-1,
                  respectively. It is found that the long micelles of
                  type II, which are not present at time t = 0, begin
                  to grow a short time after switching on the
                  shear. The number of surfactant molecules bound in
                  type I micelles decreases, whereas the number of
                  molecules bound in micelles of type II
                  increases. The sum of both remains constant. The
                  growth of the large micelles proceeds according to
                  the Avrami law, which was originally designed to
                  describe nucleation and growth reactions in metals
                  and alloys.},

                  we find a number of diffusion-controlled regimes of
                  essentially nonexponential stress relaxation. This

                  classical theory of Cates and its more recent
                  generalizations. The non-exponential relaxation is
                  due to strong correlations between chain scissions
                  and recombinations: multiple self-recombinations are
                  much more frequent than recombinations with other
                  chains and are resulting in fast release of
                  topological constraints (entanglement tube
                  coarsening). The strong renormalization effect of
                  correlations on the lifetime of a living chain (the
                  time period tau(b) until the chain breaks and one of
                  its fragments recombines with another chain) is also

                  defining the dynamics are controlled by the
                  activation energy for chain recombination and by the
                  chain rigidity. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2007.},

                  interpreted as the result of pre-smectic ordering as
                  recently proposed by Cates, 3) a parallel alignment

                  generated and strongly affected the flow
                  properties. The maximum value of viscosity in the

                  appeared up to 40 times as high as the complex
                  viscosity measured under oscillatory shear flow. The
                  coefficient of first normal stress difference also
                  increased by the appearance of SIS. Thus, SIS showed
                  not only high viscosity but also strong
                  elasticity. At low shear rates, the strain value at
                  the viscosity maximum was smaller than that at the

                  ratio of the first normal stress difference to the

                  but is diffusion-controlled and dominated by
                  self-recombination events. We observe that the
                  long-time stress relaxation of unentangled chains is
                  proportional to root1/t exp[-t/tau(relax)], with a

                  is a critical tool in elucidating their molecular

                  (orientation) under extension in microfluidic
                  cross-slots, whose flow kinematics was examined by
                  microparticle image velocimetry. The effects of
                  planar extension on the (non) linear viscoelasticity
                  of wormlike micellar surfactant solutions
                  (comprising either cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or
                  cetylpyridinium chloride in aqueous sodium
                  salicylate) were measured. The effect of wall shear
                  was found to be negligible compared to
                  extension. The birefringence is linear (indicating
                  the validity of the stress-optical rule) for very
                  small extensional Weissenberg numbers, as
                  expected. This rule fails, however, when a sharp
                  birefringence band appears at modest Weissenberg
                  number (indicating the alignment of wormlike
                  micelles along the outflow direction). Experiments
                  that measure average birefringence may misidentify
                  the point of failure of the stress-optical
                  rule. These bands also scatter light and appear in
                  transmittance images, yet with distinctive
                  features. At higher flow rates, the birefringent
                  band broadens after the peak retardation saturates,
                  but the transmittance band remains narrow and
                  eventually the flow becomes asymmetric. This
                  asymmetric transition is elasticity-induced, and no
                  shear banding is observed by particle velocimetry:
                  the velocity profiles remain linear, while the flow
                  becomes asymmetric. These phenomena are common to
                  both fluids studied, but the stress-optical
                  coefficient and the Weissenberg numbers at saturated
                  birefringence differ quantitatively, possibly due to
                  differences in micellar length and scission

                  realizations. It is still often argued by many
                  authors that, for rheologically simple fluids, a
                  maximum in a flow curve is inadmissible on physical
                  grounds. A simple thixotropic (isotropic viscous)
                  constitutive model, based on a simple structure
                  parameter, which includes yield stress and which is
                  known experimentally to be realistic for gelling
                  suspensions, is shown to predict such
                  maxima. Changes in either stress or flow rate, as in
                  startup, lead to unsteady flows, whose ultimate
                  steady-state nature are history dependent. This
                  history dependence can be removed by introducing a
                  term in the conservation equations to represent
                  diffusion of structure.},

                  of scission on nonlinear flow and rheochaos},
  Journal = Lang,
  Volume = {22},
  Number = {9},
  Pages = {3980-3987},
  Abstract = {The linear and nonlinear rheology of viscoelastic mixed
                  anionic-zwitterionic surfactant solutions has been
                  systematically investigated. In the linear
                  viscoelastic regime, these systems display nearly
                  Maxwellian behavior with a unique relaxation time,
                  To, and a characteristic elastic plateau modulus,
                  Go. Linear rheological data were used to calculate
                  the reptation and breaking times of the micelles,
                  tau(rep) and tau(b), respectively. Surprisingly, the
                  elastic modulus Go significantly increases with salt
                  concentration c(s), whereas tau(b) decreases by 1
                  order of magnitude. The strong effect of c(s) on the
                  material parameters and microstructure of rodlike
                  micelles allowed for the systematic investigation of
                  the effect of these parameters on nonlinear
                  flow. For samples with relatively long tau(b), the
                  quasi-static flow diagram (stress vs shear rate)
                  shows a stress peak followed by a metastable branch
                  (a region of decreasing shear stress), whereas for
                  samples with relatively short tau(b), this
                  phenomenon is not observed. Transient flow responses
                  corroborate quasi-static flow findings and further
                  reveal the significance of microscopic dynamic
                  parameters on flow behavior. Shear stress time
                  series were recorded at constant shear rates, and
                  above a critical shear rate, gamma(c2), stress
                  fluctuations are observed. The amplitude of these
                  stress fluctuations, Act, was found to scale as
                  Delta sigma similar or equal to G(0)(tau(b)vertical
                  bar gamma-gamma(c2)vertical bar)(beta) with beta
                  approximate to 0.5. This scaling is observed for
                  micellar systems with tau(b) ranging from 0.12 to
                  0.01 s and G(0) ranging from 1 x 10(3) to 7 x 10(3)

  Abstract = {The molecular constitution of viscoelastic gels is
                  customarily described in terms of networks, which
                  may have a transient or permanent character. Such
                  supermolecular structures are often observed in
                  biological or macromolecular systems, but can even
                  occur in dilute solutions of some
                  detergents. Surfactant molecules in solution, under
                  suitable conditions, assemble reversibly into large
                  aggregates of rod-like geometry. Depending on the
                  ionic strength of the solution. these particles may
                  be completely stiff or semiflexible. At low
                  concentrations. when the lengths of the rods are
                  much smaller than their mean distance of separation,
                  there exists a sol state which is highly sensitive
                  to shear forces. At higher surfactant
                  concentrations, where the lengths of the rod shaped
                  micelles become comparable to their mean distance,
                  one observes gel formation and the solutions exhibit
                  pronounced elastic properties. In analogy to polymer
                  systems, these elongated, rod shaped micelles are
                  strongly entangled; this leads to complicated flow
                  processes. In comparison to solutions of
                  macromolecules, there is, however, one important
                  difference. The anisometric aggregates of surface
                  active compounds are in thermal equilibrium with
                  single monomers. The permanent exchange of
                  surfactant molecules leads to breaking and
                  reformation processes of the rod shaped
                  aggregates. These kinetic processes cause thermal
                  fluctuations, which result in a finite lifetime of
                  the anisometric micelles. In situations where the
                  elongated micelles are breaking within the time
                  scale of observation, the rheological properties are
                  controlled by kinetic processes. It is just under
                  these circumstances, that we obtain very simple
                  scaling laws and linear relations between all
                  rheological quantities. From a theoretical point of
                  view, this corresponds to an ideal case, which is
                  rarely observed in other types of association
                  colloids. The viscoelastic surfactant solutions can
                  therefore be used as simple model systems for
                  studies of fundamental principles of flow. The basic
                  ideas and concepts have a general, universal
                  character which leads to a deeper insight into
                  dynamic properties and rheological mechanisms.},

  Abstract = {This paper examines the predicted flow behavior of a
                  recently published constitutive model (the RHL
                  model) for entangled polymeric fluids in a
                  co-rotating two-roll mill. The constitutive model is
                  an approximation of the
                  Doi-Edwards-Marrucci-Grizzuti (DEMG) model. The DEMG
                  model incorporates an explicit description of chain
                  stretching into the basic Doi-Edwards (DE)
                  theory. Thus, the DEMG and the approximate RHL
                  models both exhibit strain-rate softening (or
                  thinning) behavior similar to the DE model for
                  strain rates that are less than the inverse of the
                  largest Rouse relaxation time. This behavior
                  includes the well-known but controversial prediction
                  of a non-monotonic dependence of the shear stress on
                  the shear rate in steady, viscometric flows. The
                  objectives of the present work are two-fold. First,
                  we explore whether the flow simulations capture the
                  decrease in the strength of the extensional flow at
                  the stagnation point of the two-roll mill that is
                  observed experimentally for entangled polymer
                  solutions. A similar decrease in the extensional
                  strength of the flow is both observed and predicted
                  for dilute polymer solutions, but for these systems
                  this behavior is a consequence of the fact that the
                  extensional viscosity increases monotonically with
                  increasing shear rate. On the other hand, for
                  entangled polymer solutions, as well. as the RHL
                  approximation to the DE theory, the viscosity
                  decreases with increasing strain rate for strain
                  rates smaller than the inverse of the longest Rouse
                  relaxation time. The second objective is to explore
                  how the non-monotonicity of the stress is manifested
                  in a complex flow system where the flow-type is

  Abstract = {A filament stretching rheometer is used to follow the
                  evolution in the tensile force and the flow induced
                  birefringence of a wormlike micelle solution
                  experiencing a uniaxial elongation flow. The
                  experiments are performed using a series of wormlike
                  micelle solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
                  and sodium salicylate in de-ionized water. The
                  linear viscoelastic shear rheology of the wormlike
                  micelle solutions is well described by an upper
                  convected Maxwell model with a single relaxation
                  time. In transient homogeneous uniaxial extension,
                  the wormlike micelle solutions demonstrate
                  significant strain hardening and a failure of the
                  stress-optical, however, no stress-conformation
                  hysteresis is observed. A quantitative fit to the
                  extensional rheology of each of the wormlike micelle
                  solution tested is achieved with a FENE-PM model
                  having as few as two relaxation modes. At a critical
                  stress, nearly independent of strain rate, the
                  wormlike micelle solutions filaments are found to
                  fail through a dramatic rupture near the axial
                  midplane. This filament failure is not the result of
                  elastocapillary thinning as is commonly observed in
                  the filament stretching of weakly strain hardening
                  polymer solutions. Instead, the filament failure
                  might stem from the local scission of individual
                  wormlike micelle chains. The energy of wormlike
                  micelle chain scission is calculated to be roughly
                  (4) under bar k(B)T for all the solutions tested,
                  nearly independent of both the imposed extension
                  rate and the concentration of the surfactant and the
                  salt. (C) 2003 The Society of Rheology.},

                  small-angle neutron scattering under shear to
                  investigate the flow, orientation, and texture
                  properties of nematic solutions of equilibrium or
                  ''living'' polymers. The elementary objects of these
                  liquid crystalline phases are wormlike micelles,
                  that is, flexible cylindrical aggregates made of
                  amphiphile molecules. The aqueous surfactant
                  solutions investigated here (cetylpyridinium
                  chloride and hexanol in 0.2 M NaCl-brine) exhibit
                  the classical structural sequence:
                  isotropic/nematic/hexagonal with increasing
                  surfactant concentration phi. The nematic phase
                  observed for phi = 34\%-38\% consists of very long
                  cylindrical micelles closely packed parallel to each
                  other, thus producing long-range orientational
                  order. We have shown that when subjected to a steady
                  shear, the nematic phase of living polymers behaves
                  very similarly to that of the conventional liquid
                  crystalline polymers. From the rheo-optical
                  observations, we demonstrated that so-called band
                  textures show up perpendicular to the flow direction
                  after cessation of the shearing, indicating a
                  modulation of the director orientation. As for
                  Liquid crystalline polymers, these textures are
                  interpreted in terms of relaxation of the Frank
                  distorsional energy accumulated during the now. The
                  time evolution of the average band spacing of the
                  texture could be determined and compared to recent
                  theoretical predictions;e.g. in the low-shear regime
                  the squared band spacing scales linearly with
                  time. We also study the evolution of the order
                  parameter of the nematic state (actually spatially
                  averaged over the mesoscopic textures observed
                  during the flow or at rest) determined from
                  small-angle neutron scattering spectra obtained
                  under shear. As remarkable features, we found out
                  that above a characteristic shear rate, gamma(c),
                  the nematic living polymers form an orientational
                  monodomain which in addition is remarkably stable
                  over a long period of time. The present data are
                  compared to those reported for liquid crystalline
                  polymers.},

                  evidenced banded flows at the onset of this
                  shear-induced transition which are well accounted
                  for by the classical picture of shear banding. In
                  the present paper, we focus on the temporal
                  fluctuations of the flow field recorded in the
                  coexistence domain. These striking dynamics are very
                  slow (100-1000 s) and cannot be due to external

  Journal = Lang,
  Volume = {20},
  Number = {9},
  Pages = {3564-3573},
  Abstract = {Polymer solutions in the vicinity of the theta-point are
                  known to undergo shear-induced turbidity or phase
                  separation. The present study shows that a similar
                  phenomenon also occurs for certain wormlike micellar
                  solutions. Wormlike micelles are the self-assembled
                  counterparts of polymers and are characterized by
                  their ability to reversibly break and recombine. In
                  the system of interest, the micelles are formed by
                  the cationic surfactant erucyl
                  bis(hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (EHAC), in
                  conjunction with a salt such as sodium chloride
                  (NaCl) or sodium salicylate (NaSal). Micellar
                  samples that become turbid under shear show evidence
                  of critical concentration fluctuations and may
                  contain predominantly branched micelles. The
                  shear-induced turbidity in these samples correlates
                  with the appearance of flow-dichroism in rheooptic
                  experiments and with an increase in low-q scattering
                  in small-angle light scattering under flow
                  (flow-SALS) experiments. The characteristic
                  butterfly pattern, with enhanced scattering in the
                  flow direction and a dark streak perpendicular to
                  the flow direction, is typically observed in
                  flow-SALS. The results suggest that the turbidity is
                  due to a shear-induced growth of concentration
                  fluctuations, which in turn manifests as large
                  anisotropic domains, typically oriented along the
                  vorticity axis.},

  Abstract = {The effects of shear flow on the lecithin organogels
                  consisting of reverse polymer-like micelles have
                  been investigated by dynamic rheology. It was
                  established that the shear effects depended on the
                  molar ratio of water to lecithin that determined the
                  micellar type in the system. For an organogel with
                  linear flexible polymer-like micelles, thinning was
                  observed. The main features of the rheological
                  behavior bore a resemblance to previously
                  investigated aqueous systems made up of similar but
                  direct polymer-like surfactant micelles. The
                  thinning effects are explicable on the basis of
                  alignment of micellar aggregates along the flow
                  direction and their disentanglement. An organogel
                  with branched micelles did not demonstrate any
                  notable response to the shearing. Unusual behavior
                  was noticed in the case of a jelly-like phase that
                  included the highest amounts of water. The applied
                  steady shear flow induced a thickening effect. This
                  was followed by restructuring of the micellar system
                  at the level of polymer-like micelles and their
                  network. The shearing effects were characterized by
                  slow kinetics, in addition, the system did not
                  revert to the original state after the cessation of
                  steady shear flow even within 8 h. Measurements
                  performed in an oscillation regime on this system
                  showed that shearing should promote a substantial
                  growth of the polymer-like micelles and affect their
                  alignment.},

                  that the solution shows pronounced viscoelastic
                  behavior as concentrated polymer systems
                  do. However, a mechanism for a process responsible
                  for the longest relaxation time of the threadlike
                  nucellar system is different from that of
                  semi-dilute to concentrated polymer systems. The
                  threadlike micellar system exhibits unique
                  viscoelasticity described by a Maxwell model. The
                  longest relaxation time of the threadlike micellar
                  system is not a function of the concentration of
                  CTApTS, but changes with that of p-toluenesufonate
                  (pTS(-)) ions in the bulk aqueous phase supplied by
                  adding sodium p-toluenesulfonate (NapTS). The rates
                  of molecular motions in the threadlike micelles are
                  not influenced by the concentration of pTS- anions,
                  therefore, molecular motions in the threadlike
                  micelles (micro-dynamics) are independent of the
                  longest relaxation mechanism (macro-dynamics). A
                  nonionic surfactant, oleyldimethylamineoxide (ODAO),
                  forms long threadlike micelles in aqueous solution
                  without any additives. The aqueous threadlike
                  micellar system of ODAO also shows Maxwell type
                  viscoelastic behavior. However, the relaxation
                  mechanism for the longest relaxation process in the
                  system should be different from that in the
                  threadlike micellar systems of CTApTS, since the
                  system of ODAO does not contain additive
                  anions. Because increase in the average degree of
                  protonation of head groups of ODAO molecules in
                  micelles due to adding hydrogen bromide causes the

                  micro-structure and micro-dynamics in the threadlike
                  micelle are closely related to macro-dynamics in

                  viscoelasticity, keeping a single set of relaxation

                  with each other at C-S* greater than or equal to 30
                  mmol kg(-1). This implies that formed threadlike
                  micelles in both systems have similar structure and
                  the relaxation mechanism is controlled by C-S*, but

  Abstract = {A cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium
                  p-toluenesufonate (CTApTS), forms long threadlike
                  micelles in aqueous solution. The threadlike
                  micelles make concentrated entanglement networks to
                  show pronounced viscoelastic behavior as well as
                  concentrated polymer systems. However, a responsible
                  mechanism for the longest relaxation mode of the
                  threadlike micellar system is different from that of
                  the polymer system. The threadlike micellar system
                  exhibits unique viscoelasticity described well by a
                  Maxwell model. The longest relaxation time of the
                  threadlike micellar system is not a function of the
                  concentration of CTApTS, but of p-toluenesufonate
                  (pTS(-)) ions in the bulk aqueous phase supplied by
                  added sodium p-toluenesulfonate (NapTS). The rates
                  of molecular motions in the threadlike micelles are
                  not influenced by the concentration of pTS(-)
                  anions, therefore, molecular motions in the
                  threadlike micelles (microdynamics) are independent
                  of the longest relaxation mode (macro-dynamics). A
                  nonionic surfactant, oleyldimethylamineoxide (ODAO),
                  forms long threadlike micelles in aqueous solution
                  without any additives. The aqueous threadlike
                  micellar system of ODAO also shows Maxwell type
                  viscoelastic behavior. However, the relaxation
                  mechanism for the longest relaxation process in the
                  system should be different from that in the
                  threadlike micellar systems of CTApTS, since the
                  system of ODAO does not contain additive
                  anions. Because increase in the average degree of
                  protonation of ODAO head groups in micelles by
                  adding hydrogen bromide lengthens the relaxation
                  time remarkably,changes in microstructure and
                  micro-dynamics in the threadlike micelle are closely
                  related to macro-dynamics in contrast with the
                  threadlike micellar system of CTApTS.},

  Abstract = {Formation of wormlike micelles in mixed anionic/cationic
                  system without the addition of any salt has been
                  studied. Amino-acid based anionic surfactant
                  N-dodecylglutamic acid (LAD), which is practically
                  immiscible with water at 25 degrees C upon
                  neutralization by 2,2,2 ''-nitrilotriethanol (TEA)
                  forms small micellar aggregates and the solution
                  behaves like a Newtonian fluid. The theological
                  behavior of LAD/water/hexadecyltrimethylammonium
                  bromide (CTAB) and
                  LAD/water/dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB)
                  systems were investigated at different degrees of
                  neutralization of the LAD depending on the
                  concentration of the cationic surfactants and on
                  temperature. Addition of CTAB to the dilute aqueous
                  solution of the LAD-TEA-x (the neutralized product,
                  where x represents the mole ratio of TEA) causes one
                  dimensional micellar growth. After certain
                  concentration the elongated micelles entangle
                  forming a rigid network of viscoelastic wormlike
                  micelles. Thus formed viscoelastic solutions follow
                  Maxwellian behavior over a wide range of frequency
                  and thus are considered to consist of transient
                  network of wormlike micelles. By varying the degree
                  of neutralization from 1:1 via 1:1.5 to 1:2 (molar
                  ratio) phase and theological behavior were modified
                  in that the highly viscous region of viscoelastic
                  wormlike micelles shifted to higher CTAB
                  concentrations and no maxima in the zero-shear
                  viscosity could be observed for the higher degree of
                  neutralization of the LAD (1:1.5 and 1:2). However,
                  the obtained theological parameters showed scaling
                  relationships that were consistent with the living
                  polymer model. The zero-shear viscosity decays
                  exponentially with temperature following Arrhenius
                  behavior. The flow activation energy calculated from
                  the Arrhenius plot is very close to the value
                  reported for the typical wormlike micellar
                  solution. In contrast to CTAB no formation of
                  viscoelastic wormlike micelles could be observed
                  with DTAB, although, the solution viscosity
                  increases. The elongated micelles could not entangle
                  to form a rigid network of wormlike micelles in this
                  system. For the first time viscoelastic wormlike
                  micelles could be obtained in salt-free mixed
                  anionic/cationic surfactant systems. (C) 2007

  Abstract = {The role of molecular weight in shear-induced structure
                  transitions, such as striations during shear startup
                  and banding during relaxation, was probed through
                  small-angle light scattering and shear
                  microscopy. The characteristic texture relaxation
                  time for banding, tau(s), is molecular weight
                  dependent. The minimum molecular weight for these
                  shear-induced complex texture transitions to occur
                  is estimated from tau(s) as 27 000 for a 37 wt \%

                  rate, implying that it is a material property. Thus,

                  during shear startup and the preshear rate
                  dependence of the banding phenomenon exhibit little
                  or no molecular weight dependence. Increasing
                  molecular weight does appear to decrease the

                  fluids},
  Journal = JNNFM,
  Volume = {115},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {1-25},
  Abstract = {Observations are presented of several novel phenomena
                  involved in the dynamics of a pendant drop of
                  viscoelastic micellar fluid falling through
                  air. Generally, when a drop falls a filament forms
                  connecting it to the orifice; the filament
                  eventually breaks due to an instability. The
                  filament dynamics and instabilities reported here
                  are very different from the standard Newtonian and
                  non-Newtonian cases. At low surfactant
                  concentration, the cylindrical filament necks down
                  and pinches off rapidly (similar to10 ms) at one
                  location along the filament. After pinch-off, the
                  free filament ends retract and no satellite drops
                  are produced. At higher concentrations, the
                  pinch-off also occurs along the filament, but in a
                  more gradual process (similar to1 s). Furthermore,
                  the free filament ends do not fully retract, instead
                  retaining some of their deformation. The falling
                  drop is also observed to slow or even stop (stall)
                  before pinch-off, indicating that sufficient elastic
                  stress has built up to balance its weight. We
                  investigate this stall by generalizing Keiller's
                  simple model for filament motion [J. Non-Newtonian
                  Fluid Mech. 42 (1992) 37], using instead the FENE-CR
                  constitutive equation. Numerical simulations of this
                  model indicate that stall occurs in the range of low
                  solvent viscosity, high elasticity, and high
                  molecular weight. At the highest concentrations, we
                  observe a surface blistering instability along the
                  filament long before pinch-off occurs. (C) 2003

                  temperature sweeps are also reported. The Krafft
                  temperature (T-K) Of CTAT/water is 23 degrees
                  C. Below this value, triclinic crystals of CTAT
                  coexist with an isotropic solution. Above T-K and at
                  low concentrations, spherical micellar solutions are
                  Newtonian and exhibit low viscosities. At higher
                  concentrations (c(t)), cylindrical micelles form and
                  viscosity increases dramatically with CTAT
                  concentration, but no elastic effects are
                  noticed. When micelles are long enough to entangle
                  (0.9-27 wt \% at 25 degrees C), clear viscoelastic
                  solutions form. At higher concentrations and up to
                  47 wt \%, an hexagonal phase appears. This phase
                  exhibits yield stress and viscoelasticity. At higher
                  concentrations, a nonelastic, viscous solid paste
                  forms. Micellar solutions and hexagonal phase
                  depicts three regimes of viscoelasticity with
                  temperature. These regimes are bounded by T-K and by
                  the temperature (T-tau) at which the system exhibits
                  its main relaxation time. T-tau moves to lower
                  temperatures as CTAT concentration increases
                  indicating that the main relaxation time decreases

                  (CTAT)-water system is investigated in steady and

                  concentration and temperature. A rheo-optical study
                  which includes measurements of dichroism,
                  birefringence, and turbidity under now at various
                  shear rates is also discussed. The shear viscosity
                  data in steady sheer agree with the complex
                  viscosity in the limit of low deformation rates. For
                  moderate deformation rates, in the shear thinning
                  region, the Cox-Men rule is not followed. In all
                  cases, a limiting stress or plateau stress was
                  observed at shear rates that exceed one-half of the
                  reciprocal of the main relaxation time [(2
                  tau(d))(-1)]. At the stress plateau, the micellar
                  solution most Likely undergoes an
                  isotropic-to-nematic phase transition induced by
                  shear. However, our results do not conclusively
                  exclude the possibility of a constitutive
                  instability with respect to shear banding, in which
                  simultaneous shear rates coexist under controlled
                  stress experiments. In unsteady shear now,
                  CTAT-water micellar solutions exhibit a slow
                  transient behavior in which the system achieves
                  steady state in starting up experiments after tens
                  to hundreds of Maxwell relaxation times. This is
                  consistent with the existence of shear
                  banding. Metastable branches are also observed in
                  thixotropic loops produced under exponential
                  shear. The time scale of this branch coincides with
                  that of the inception of sheer flow just before the
                  overshoot peak:. Moreover, the system exhibits a
                  quasilinear rheological behavior at long times
                  characterized by an exponential relaxation with a
                  single time constant. A simple model consisting of
                  the co-deformational Maxwell constitutive equation
                  and a kinetic equation for construction and
                  destruction of structure is proposed to predict

                  detected at 0.2 wt\% by viscometry, conductimetry
                  and dye solubilization measurements. The rheology of
                  the DDAB/water system was studied as a function of
                  surfactant concentration and
                  temperature. Non-Newtonian behavior,
                  viscoelasticity, yield stresses and time-dependent
                  flow behavior were observed. Maxima and minima in
                  the dynamic moduli and in conductivity are related
                  to structural changes and phase
                  transitions. Moreover, in time-dependent shear flow,
                  the microstructure is modified and the rheological
                  response shifts from thixotropic to antithixotropic
                  or vice versa, depending on the DDAB concentration
                  and the level and duration of the final applied
                  stress. The conductivity behavior in the Lam(1)
                  phase region can be qualitatively explained by the
                  capillary superconductivity theory. This
                  conductivity behavior occurs when the thickness of
                  the aqueous lamella is of the same order of
                  magnitude as the Debye length.},

  Abstract = {Several surfactant molecules self-assemble in solution
                  to form long, cylindrical, flexible wormlike
                  micelles. These micelles can be entangled with each
                  other leading to viscoelastic phases. The
                  rheological properties of such phases are very
                  interesting and have been the subject of a large
                  number of experimental and theoretical studies in
                  recent years. We shall report our recent work on the
                  macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow
                  behaviour of dilute aqueous solutions of a
                  surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium
                  Tosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and
                  exhibits strong viscoelasticity at low
                  concentrations (similar to 0.9 wt\%) without the
                  addition of electrolytes. Microrheology measurements
                  of G(omega) have been done using diffusing wave
                  spectroscopy which will be compared with the
                  conventional frequency sweep measurements done using
                  a cone and plate rheometer. The second part of the
                  paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the
                  measured shear stress sigma is a nonmonotonic
                  function of the shear rate (gamma) over dot. In
                  stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress
                  shows a plateau for (gamma) over dot larger than
                  some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier
                  reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates ei nl have
                  proposed that the plateau is a signature of
                  mechanical instability in the form of shear
                  bands. We have carried out extensive experiments
                  under controlled strain rate conditions, to study
                  the time-dependence of shear stress. The measured
                  time series of shear stress has been analysed in
                  terms of correlation integral and Lyapunov exponent
                  to show unambiguously that the behaviour is typical
                  of low dimensional dynamical systems.},

                  behaviour exhibiting regular, quasi-periodic,
                  intermittency and chaos is observed. In particular,
                  we have shown experimentally that the route to chaos
                  is via Type-II intermittency in shear thinning
                  worm-like micellar solution of
                  cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate where the strength

                  SALS, sensitive to orientational order fluctuations,

                  normal stress increases roughly linearly with shear
                  rate over several decades. Here we explain this

                  model for the dynamics of reversibly breakable,
                  polymerlike micelles. The constitutive equation for
                  this model leads to a flow instability of
                  shear-banding type. The limiting shear stress is

                  modification of the tube model, based on the concept
                  of a dumbbell confined to a pipe, was recently

                  drastically different depending on whether the shear

                  competing mainly with the reptation motions of the

                  involving transient star polymeric crosslinks, a

                  decanol, and water. For total surfactant and
                  cosurfactant concentrations of about 30\% by weight,
                  we prepared nematic calamitic N-C and nematic
                  discotic N-D solutions. We have studied the flow
                  behavior of the N-C and N-D phases in terms of the
                  transient shear stress using different rheological
                  histories. In flow-reversal experiments, the
                  transient response exhibits nonperiodic oscillations
                  in the region of small deformations (gamma = 20),
                  which is followed by a long-lasting relaxation
                  toward the stationary state. In the pseudo-Newtonian
                  regime of the viscosity; we have found that the
                  stress, when normalized to its long term value and
                  plotted versus deformation, is shear-rate
                  independent. H-2 NMR measurements at rest and under
                  shear were performed on nematic calamitic and
                  discotic solutions prepared in D2O. At rest, the NMR
                  spectra exhibit well-resolved doublet structures,
                  which indicate an alignment of the director along
                  the axis of the magnetic field. At shear rates large
                  enough ((gamma) over dot > 0.3 s(-1)) alignment is
                  achieved with respect to the flow velocity. One
                  finds alignment angles of 12 degrees and 105 degrees
                  for the directors of the calamitic and discotic
                  phase, respectively. Combining the results obtained
                  by rheology and by NMR, we provide strong evidence
                  that the N-C and N-D nematics of the sodium dodecyl
                  sulfate / decanol system are textured nematics of

  Abstract = {Wormlike micelles are flexible polymerlike chains formed
                  by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules either
                  in water (normal worms) or in oil (reverse
                  worms). Normal and reverse worms have both been
                  studied extensively and have generally been found to
                  exhibit analogous rheological properties (e.g.,
                  Maxwell fluidlike behavior). Here, we report a
                  hitherto unexplored difference between these two
                  classes of micelles pertaining to the effect of
                  temperature on their rheological properties. For
                  normal worms, the plateau modulus remains constant
                  as the sample is heated while the relaxation time
                  exponentially decreases. For reverse worms, however,
                  both the plateau modulus and the relaxation time
                  decrease exponentially upon heating. Consequently,
                  the zero-shear viscosity of reverse worms decreases
                  more rapidly with temperature than for normal
                  worms. To explain these differences, we propose that
                  increasing the temperature weakens the driving force
                  for micellization in reverse worms whereas it only
                  accelerates the dynamics of surfactant exchange in
                  normal worms.},

  Abstract = {The dynamics of self-assembling rod-like micelles under
                  both elongational and shear flow have been studied
                  theoretically. For simplicity, a two-dimensional
                  model that is analytically tractable was used;
                  results for three-dimensional systems are also
                  discussed. Simple reaction kinetics were assumed in
                  which two micelles can fuse only if they are
                  collinear. This provides a positive feedback between
                  micellar alignment and growth, which was studied in
                  the regime where micelle-micelle reactions are
                  frequent on the timescale of rotational
                  diffusion. In two dimensions under elongational flow
                  a strong maximum in the mean rod length along the
                  flow axis is predicted. This maximum mean length
                  diverges as a power of the flow rate but does not
                  exhibit an abrupt transition to an aligned 'gel'
                  state, in contrast to our earlier results for the
                  three-dimensional system. In two-dimensional shear
                  flow it is shown that the absence of a stable
                  equilibrium direction (in conjuction with Brownian
                  diffusion) also prevents a sharp transition. The
                  existence of a transition in a full
                  three-dimensional shear-flow geometry remains an
                  open theoretical question (although the experimental
                  evidence is in favour); a scaling approach is
                  outlined that should allow this issue to be
                  resolved.},

                  glycerol/water and formamide/water mixed
                  solvents. The obtained results are compared with
                  those reported in pure water for the corresponding
                  mixed surfactant systems. The zero-shear viscosity
                  first sharply increases with C12EO3 addition and
                  then decreases; i.e., there is a viscosity
                  maximum. The intensity (viscosity) and position
                  (C12EO3 fraction) of this maximum shift to lower
                  values upon an increase in the ratio of glycerol in
                  the glycerol/water mixed solvent, while the position
                  of the maximum changes in an opposite way with
                  increasing formamide. In the case of the SDS/C12EO3
                  system, zero-shear viscosity shows a decrease with
                  an increase of temperature, but for the
                  ChEO(15)/C12EO3 system, again, the zero-shear
                  viscosity shows a maximum if plotted as a function
                  of temperature, its position depending on the C12EO3
                  mixing fraction. In the studied nonionic systems,
                  worm micelles seem to exist at low temperatures
                  (down to 0 degrees C) and high glycerol
                  concentrations (up to 50 wt \%), which is
                  interesting from the viewpoint of applications such
                  as drag reduction fluids. Rheology results are
                  supported by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and
                  dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements on
                  nonionic systems, which indicate micellar elongation
                  upon addition of glycerol or increasing temperature
                  and shortening upon addition of formamide. The
                  results can be interpreted in terms of changes in

                  version of Cates' 'living polymer'
                  theory. Specifically we consider two elastically
                  active Hookean species: long chains which can break
                  to form two short chains, which can themselves
                  recombine to form a long chain. The chains undergo
                  rupture at a rate dependent on the local elongation
                  and deformation rate. This two species model,
                  developed ultimately to enable understanding of
                  inhomogeneous flows, is examined in this paper for
                  various deformations; steady-state shear flow, step
                  strain, extension, and linear small amplitude
                  oscillatory flow in homogeneous conditions. We also

                  the complex flow, rheology, and microstructure of
                  complex fluids. It is based on the concept that
                  material microstructure controls rheology as well as
                  optical properties, and that rheology and
                  microstructure are usually strongly coupled. Recent

                  mol/l; 28.3 g/l), spherical micelles of FOSTEA were
                  connected with each other to form threads of
                  pearl-necklace shape. These threads were further
                  organized into a transient network to exhibit linear
                  relaxation characteristic of living polymers,
                  single-mode terminal relaxation widely separated
                  from faster relaxation processes. Nonlinear
                  relaxation experiments against large step-strains
                  gamma(less than or equal to 8) revealed that the
                  terminal relaxation mode had a gamma-insensitive
                  relaxation time but its relaxation intensity
                  exhibited significant damping (much stronger than

  Journal = JNNFM,
  Volume = {75},
  Number = {2-3},

  Abstract = {Using various optical and mechanical techniques we
                  report on a shear induced structure (STS) that
                  results in instabilities during flow. The solution
                  in this study is an equimolar solution of
                  cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate. In
                  this investigation we further probe the hypothesis
                  of Rehage et al. that an SIS occurs [I]. We find
                  that not only does an SIS occur but as the solution
                  is subjected to stronger flows it becomes turbid
                  before forming ring-like structures which alternate
                  in intensity both spatially and temporally. Since
                  the rings alternate periodically it is evident that
                  the flow not only forms these structures but is also
                  capable of destroying them as well. Simultaneously
                  measuring birefringence and mechanical properties we
                  observe the same periodic oscillations in the
                  birefringence. On the other hand these ring-like
                  structures are present in the parallel plate, cone
                  and plate, and Taylor Couette how cells. These rings
                  are similar in appearance to those seen for elastic
                  instabilities in Boger fluids seeded with mica
                  flakes. In a constant stress rheometer the shear
                  rate exhibits overshoots and fluctuations again
                  resembling the behavior of elastic instabilities in
                  Boger fluids. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

  Title = {Structure and rheology of wormlike micelles},
  Journal = {Rheologica Acta},
  Volume = {35},
  Number = {2},
  Pages = {139-149},
  Abstract = {In a semi-dilute aqueous solution under certain
                  conditions, surfactant molecules will self assemble
                  to form wormlike micelles. The micelles are dynamic
                  in structure since they can break and reform,
                  providing an additional mode of relaxation. The
                  viscoelastic properties of the wormlike micelles can
                  be predicted using simple rheological models. For
                  many surfactant solutions the mechanical data can be
                  related to the optical data by the stress-optical
                  rule. From the viscoelastic data it is possible to
                  estimate the breaking time of the micelle. The
                  techniques of birefringence and small angle light
                  scattering are used to study the microstructure of a
                  surfactant solution under simple shear and
                  extensional flow The sample under investigation is a
                  solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and
                  sodium salicylate in water, with a salt to
                  surfactant ratio of 7.7. Below a critical shear
                  rate, the birefringence increases linearly with
                  shear rate and the stress-optical rule is valid. The
                  SALS patterns reveal distinctive butterfly patterns
                  indicating that scattering is a result of
                  concentration fluctuations that moderately couple to
                  the flow. However, above a critical shear rate the
                  birefringence plateaus and the stress-optical rule
                  is no longer valid. SALS patterns show both a bright
                  streak and a butterfly pattern. The bright streak is
                  caused by elongated structures aligned in the
                  direction of the flow. The oriented structures occur
                  when the characteristic time of flow is faster than
                  the breaking time of the micelles.},

  Journal = JNNFM,
  Volume = {138},

  Note = {Wilson, Helen J. Fielding, Suzanne M.},
  Abstract = {We consider the linear stability of shear banded planar
                  Couette flow of the Johnson-Segalman fluid, with and
                  without the addition of stress diffusion to
                  regularise the equations. In particular, we
                  investigate the linear stability of an initially
                  one-dimensional base flow, with a flat interface
                  between the bands, to two-dimensional perturbations
                  representing undulations along the interface. We
                  demonstrate analytically that, for the linear
                  stability problem, the limit in which diffusion
                  tends to zero is mathematically equivalent to a pure
                  (non-diffusive) Johnson-Segalman model with a
                  material interface between the shear bands, provided
                  the wavelength of perturbations being considered is
                  long relative to the (short) diffusion
                  lengthscale. For no diffusion, we find that the flow
                  is unstable to long waves for almost all
                  arrangements of the two shear bands. In particular,
                  for any set of fluid parameters and shear stress
                  there is some arrangement of shear bands that shows
                  this instability. Typically the stable arrangements
                  of bands are those in which one of the two bands is
                  very thin. Weak diffusion provides a small
                  stabilising effect, rendering extremely long waves
                  marginally stable. However, the basic long-wave
                  instability mechanism is not affected by this, and
                  where there would be instability as wavenumber k ->
                  0 in the absence of diffusion, we observe
                  instability for moderate to long waves even with
                  diffusion. This paper is the first full analytical
                  investigation into an instability first documented
                  in the numerical study of Fielding [S.M. Fielding,
                  Linear instability of planar shear banded flow,
                  Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 (2005) 134501]. Authors prior to
                  that work have either happened to choose parameters
                  where long waves are stable or used slightly
                  different constitutive equations and Poiseuille
                  flow, for which the parameters for instability
                  appear to be much more restricted. We identify two
                  driving terms that can cause instability: one, a
                  jump in N-1, as reported previously by Hinch et
                  al. [E.J. Hinch, O.J. Harris, J.M. Rallison, The
                  instability mechanism for two elastic liquids being

                  311-324]; the second, a discontinuity in shear
                  rate. The mechanism for instability from the second
                  of these is not thoroughly understood. We discuss
                  the relevance of this work to recent experimental
                  observations of complex dynamics seen in
                  shear-banded flows. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

  Abstract = {The plastics industry today sees huge wastage through
                  product defects caused by unstable flows during the
                  manufacturing process. In addition, many production
                  lines are through put-limited by a flow speed
                  threshold above which the process becomes
                  unstable. Therefore, it is critically important to
                  understand the mechanisms behind these
                  instabilities. In order to investigate the flow of a
                  molten plastic, the first step is a model of the
                  liquid itself, a relation between its current stress
                  and its flow history called a constitutive
                  relation. These are derived in many ways and tested
                  on several benchmark flows, but rarely is the
                  stability of the model used as a criterion for
                  selection. The relationship between the constitutive
                  model and the stability properties of even simple
                  flows is not yet well understood. We show that in
                  one case a small change to the model, which does not
                  affect the steady flow behaviour, entirely removes a
                  known instability. In another, a change that makes a
                  qualitative difference to the steady flow makes only
                  tiny changes to the stability. The long-term vision
                  of this research is to exactly quantify what are the
                  important properties of a constitutive relation as
                  far as stability is concerned. If we could
                  understand that, not only could very simple
                  stability experiments be used to choose the best
                  constitutive models for a particular material, but
                  our ability to predict and avoid wasteful industrial
                  instabilities would also be vastly improved.},

  Abstract = {Simulations of mixed cationic/anionic wormlike micellar
                  systems have been carried out for a wide range of
                  compositions, including pure anionic and cationic
                  systems. It was found that the wormlike micelle
                  formed by only cationic surfactant molecules is
                  unstable and transforms to a set of small spherical
                  micelles. Adding anionic surfactants with a short
                  hydrophobic chain (only eight carbon atoms) results
                  in stable wormlike micelles. The 34/66
                  cationic/anionic worm is stable and symmetrical,
                  while the 50/50 mixture yields a flattened worm,
                  indicating a phase transition to the lamellar
                  phase. All these observations are in excellent
                  agreement with the experimental results of Raghavan
                  et al. (Langmuir 2002, 18, 3797), and they provide a
                  molecular mechanism for their observations. The
                  addition of octyltrimethylammonium chloride
                  increases the radius of the worm due to the bigger
                  hydrophobic part. Meanwhile, the length of the worms
                  decreases with the concentration of cationic
                  surfactant and reaches a minimum for the 50/50
                  mixture. The latter system is of special interest
                  due to a zero surface charge density. The worm with
                  the electrostatically neutral surface was used to
                  investigate intermicellar interactions. The
                  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the
                  merging process requires a substantial activation
                  energy even in the case of reduced electrostatic
                  repulsion.},

                  salicylate (NaSal) as a counter ion, and the ratio
                  of mole concentration of CTAB and that of NaSal was
                  1-7.7. Two fluids that had a mole concentration
                  different from that of CTAB were used. Air was
                  injected into the cell and the growth of the
                  interface between air and a CTAB/NaSal solution was
                  observed. The fingertip grew similar to the finger
                  growth in shear-thinning fluids at low pressure
                  gradients. It took a cuspidate shape at the
                  intermediate pressure gradient, and a sudden
                  protrusion at a critical shear rate occurred. In

                  bis(2-hydroxyethyl) methyl ammonium chloride (EHAC)
                  are reported here. The influences of surfactant
                  (EHAC) and salt (NH4Cl) concentrations on the linear
                  viscoelastic parameters are determined using small
                  amplitude oscillatory shear experiments. The steady

                  double gap Couette cell, and transient extensional
                  flow measurements are performed in a capillary
                  breakup extensional rheometer (CABER). In the
                  nonlinear shear flow experiments, the micellar fluid
                  samples show strong hysteretic behavior upon
                  increasing and decreasing the imposed shear stress
                  due to the development of shear-banding
                  instabilities. The non-monotone flow curves of
                  stress versus shear rate can be successfully modeled
                  in a macroscopic sense by using the single-mode
                  Giesekus constitutive equation. The temporal
                  evolution of the flow structure of the surfactant
                  solutions in the Couette flow geometry is analyzed
                  by instantaneous shear rate measurements for various
                  values of controlled shear stress. along with FFT
                  analysis. The results indicate that the steady flow
                  bifurcates to a global time-dependent state as soon
                  as the shear-banding/hysteresis regime is
                  reached. Increasing the salt-surfactant ratio or the
                  temperature is found to stabilize the flow, and
                  corresponds to decreasing values of anisotropy
                  factor in the Giesekus model. Finally, we have
                  investigated the dynamics of capillary breakup of
                  the micellar fluid samples in uniaxial extensional
                  flow The filament thinning behavior of the micellar
                  fluid samples is also accurately predicted by the
                  Giesekus constitutive equation. Indeed quantitative
                  agreement between the experimental and numerical
                  results can be obtained providing that the
                  relaxation time of the wormlike micellar solutions
                  in extensional flows is a factor of three lower than

                  two-phase systems (ATPS) in the ternary phase
                  diagram of SDS/CTAB/H2O system. In the surfactant

                  state of ATPS, the system has high viscosity because

                  tendency to increase when salt was added to the

                  can screen the repulsion between different charged

                  surfactants and facilitates the spherical or rod
